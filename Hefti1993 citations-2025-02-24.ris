TI  - Report of the Primary Outcomes for Gait Mechanics in Men of the ACL-SPORTS Trial: Secondary Prevention With and Without Perturbation Training Does Not Restore Gait Symmetry in Men 1 or 2 Years After ACL Reconstruction.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Movement asymmetries during walking are common after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and reconstruction and may influence the early development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Preoperative neuromuscular training (like perturbation training, which is neuromuscular training requiring selective muscle activation in response to surface perturbations) improves gait asymmetries and functional outcomes among people who are ACL-deficient, but the effect of postoperative perturbation training on gait mechanics after ACL reconstruction is unknown. Among men undergoing ACL reconstruction, we sought to compare strength, agility, and secondary prevention (SAP) treatment with SAP plus perturbation training (SAP+PERT) with respect to (1) gait mechanics; and (2) elimination of gait asymmetries 1 and 2 years after ACL reconstruction. Forty men were randomized into a SAP group or a SAP+PERT group after ACL reconstruction and before returning to preinjury activities. Participants were required to achieve ≥ 80% quadriceps muscle strength symmetry, minimal knee effusion, full ROM, no reports of pain, and completion of a running progression (all between 3 and 9 months postoperatively) before enrollment. Of 94 potentially eligible athletic male patients evaluated < 9 months after ACL reconstruction, 54 were excluded for prespecified reasons. Participants underwent motion analysis during overground walking at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Variables of interest included (1) sagittal and frontal plane hip and knee angles and moments at peak knee flexion angle; (2) sagittal plane hip and knee angles and moments at peak knee extension angle; (3) sagittal plane hip and knee excursion during weight acceptance; and (4) sagittal plane hip and knee excursion during midstance. We also calculated the proportion of athletes in each group who walked with clinically meaningful interlimb asymmetry in sagittal plane hip and knee variables and compared these proportions using odds ratios. There was no differential loss to followup between groups. There were no differences between the SAP or SAP+PERT groups for the biomechanical gait variables. The involved limb’s knee excursion during midstance for the SAP (mean ± SD: 1 year: 15° ± 5°; 2 years: 16° ± 5°) and SAP+PERT (1 year: 16° ± 5°; 2 years: 15° ± 4°) athletes was not different between groups at 1 year (mean difference: −1°; 95% confidence interval [CI], −5° to 2°; p = 0.49) or 2 years (mean difference: 1°; 95% CI, −2° to 4°; p = 0.54). There were no differences between SAP and SAP+PERT athletes regarding the elimination of gait asymmetries, and gait asymmetries persisted to a large degree in both groups 1 and 2 years postoperatively. At 1 year, 11 of 18 SAP and 11 of 20 SAP+PERT athletes walked with truncated knee excursions during weight acceptance (odds ratio: 0.8, p = 0.70) and midstance (SAP 12 of 18, SAP+PERT 12 of 20; odds ratio: 0.8, p = 0.67), whereas at 2 years postoperatively, truncated knee excursions during weight acceptance (SAP seven of 17, SAP+PERT eight of 19; odds ratio: 1.0, p = 0.96) and midstance (SAP five of 17, SAP+PERT 11 of 19; odds ratio: 3.3, p = 0.09) remained prevalent. We found that a comprehensive, progressive return-to-sport training program with or without perturbation was not effective at restoring interlimb symmetry among men 1 or 2 years after ACL reconstruction. Although gait asymmetries improved from 1 to 2 years postoperatively, meaningful asymmetries persisted in both groups. To restore gait symmetry after ACL reconstruction, additional interventions likely are necessary. Level II, therapeutic study.

TI  - The incidence and significance of femoral tunnel widening after quadrupled hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using femoral cross pin fixation
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of femoral tunnel widening that occurred after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using quadrupled hamstring autografts and to determine the clinical significance of any such tunnel enlargement. Type of Study: Retrospective clinical analysis. Methods: Twenty-nine patients who had undergone reconstruction of a torn anterior cruciate ligament with quadrupled hamstring autograft and cross pin femoral fixation were evaluated to determine the incidence and significance of postoperative femoral tunnel widening. A single surgeon performed all procedures, and average follow-up was 18.4 months (range, 12 to 31.5 months). All patients underwent flexion posteroanterior and lateral radiographs, an examination for determination of an International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) rating, had KT-1000 data collected, and completed Lysholm and Knee Outcome Survey functional questionnaires. Femoral tunnels were clearly seen in 27 patients. The tunnel diameters were measured at the opening of the tunnel, at the widest part of the tunnel, and just proximal to the cross pin. The amount of tunnel widening for each patient was then compared with the individual's KT-1000 data, IKDC rating, and Lysholm and knee outcome survey scores to assess correlation. Results: Four different tunnel morphologies were noted, with the linear type being the most common. The widening at the greatest tunnel diameter was 65.5% on average. Side-to-side KT-1000 differences averaged 1.04 mm at 30 lb, and 1.10 mm at manual maximum. Eleven patients had IKDC overall ratings of normal, 13 had ratings that were nearly normal, and 2 had abnormal. Average Lysholm and knee outcome survey scores were 92.6 and 93.9, respectively. A significant correlation was found only between F2 and F3 widening with Lysholm scores. However, the significance was eliminated with removal of 2 outliers. Conclusions: The exact etiology of postoperative anterior cruciate ligament tunnel widening remains unknown. The present study reveals that significant tunnel widening occurs with quadrupled hamstring autografts and femoral cross pin fixation. However, the widening does not appear to have a significant effect on postoperative ligament laxity or functional knee scores, at least in the short term.

TI  - Chronic anterior cruciate ligament deficiency is associated with increased anterior translation of the tibia during the transition from non-weightbearing to weightbearing
PY  - 2002
AB  - Translation of the tibia relative to the femur was measured while a group of subjects with normal knees and group with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears underwent transition from non-weightbearing to weightbearing stance. Subjects were positioned in the Vermont knee laxity device (VKLD) with muscles relaxed and the limb segment and compressive joint load offset (non-weightbearing). A lateral radiograph of the knee, with the posterior aspects of the femoral condyles superimposed, was obtained to document the position of the tibia relative to the femur. Immediately after, a compressive load equal to 40% of bodyweight was applied to each foot, and a second radiograph was obtained to document the change in position of the tibia relative to the femur. The transition from non-weightbearing to weightbearing produced a significant increase of anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur (mean; 3.4 mm) for the subjects with ACL tears compared with the contralateral normal knees (0.8 mm). Similarly, there was a significant increase in anterior translation of the tibia for the subjects with ACL tears compared to the group of subjects with normal knees (1.2 mm). The fourfold increase in anterior translation of the tibia for the knees with ACL tears compared to the contralateral side is a concern because it is substantially greater than the 95% confidence limits of the side-to-side differences in anterior-posterior knee laxity measured from subjects with normal knees. This observation could explain, at least in part, one of the mechanisms that initiates damage to the meniscus and articular cartilage in subjects that have suffered an ACL tear.

TI  - Experimental Execution of the Simulated Pivot-Shift Test: A Systematic Review of Techniques
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose To conduct a systematic review to identify and summarize the various techniques that have been used to simulate the pivot-shift test in vitro. Methods Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were screened for studies involving the simulated pivot-shift test in human cadaveric knees published between 1946 and May 2014. Study parameters including sample size, study location, simulated pivot-shift technique, loads applied, knee flexion angles at which simulated pivot shift was tested, and kinematic evaluation tools were extracted and analyzed. Results Forty-eight studies reporting simulated pivot-shift testing on 627 cadaveric knees fulfilled the criteria. Reviewer inter-rater agreement for study selection showed a κ score of 0.960 (full-text review). Twenty-seven studies described the use of internal rotation torque, with a mean of 5.3 Nm (range, 1 to 18 Nm). Forty-seven studies described the use of valgus torque, with a mean of 8.8 Nm (range, 1 to 25 Nm). Four studies described the use of iliotibial tract tension, ranging from 10 to 88 N. Regarding static simulated pivot-shift test techniques, 100% of the studies performed testing at 30° of knee flexion, and the most tested range of motion in the continuous tests was 0° to 90°. Anterior tibial translation was the most analyzed parameter during the simulated pivot-shift test, being used in 45 studies. In 22% of the studies, a robotic system was used to simulate the pivot-shift test. Robotic systems were shown to have better control of the loading system and higher tracking system accuracy. Conclusions This study provides a reference for investigators who desire to apply simulated pivot shift in their in vitro studies. It is recommended to simulate the pivot-shift test using a 10-Nm valgus torque and 5-Nm internal rotation torque. Knee flexion of 30° is mandatory for testing.

TI  - Gait Mechanics in Women of the ACL-SPORTS Randomized Control Trial: Interlimb Symmetry Improves Over Time Regardless of Treatment Group.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Women after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and ACL reconstruction (ACLR) are more likely than men to exhibit asymmetric movement patterns, which are associated with post-traumatic osteoarthritis. We developed the ACL specialized post-operative return-to-sports (ACL-SPORTS) randomized control trial to test the effect of strength, agility, plyometric, and secondary prevention (SAPP) training with and without perturbation training (SAPP + PERT) on gait mechanics in women after ACLR. We hypothesized that movement symmetry would improve over time across both groups but more so among the SAPP + PERT group. Thirty-nine female athletes 3-9 months after primary ACLR were randomized to SAPP or SAPP + PERT training. Biomechanical testing during overground walking occurred before (Pre-training) and after (Post-training) training and one and 2 years post-operatively. Hip and knee kinematic and kinetic variables were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni corrections for post hoc comparisons (α = 0.05). There was a time by limb interaction effect (p = 0.028) for peak knee flexion angle (PKFA), the primary outcome which powered the study, characterized by smaller PKFA in the involved compared to uninvolved limbs across treatment groups at Pre-training, Post-training, and 1 year, but not 2 years. Similar findings occurred across sagittal plane knee excursions and kinetics and hip extension excursion at midstance. There were no meaningful interactions involving group. Neither SAPP nor SAPP + PERT training improved walking mechanics, which persisted 1 but not 2 years after ACLR. Statement of clinical significance: Asymmetrical movement patterns persisted long after participants achieved symmetrical strength and functional performance, suggesting more time is needed to recover fully after ACLR. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

TI  - Clinical comparisons of the anatomical reconstruction and modified biceps rerouting technique for chronic posterolateral instability combined with posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to describe a one-stage operation for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with use of an Achilles tendon-bone allograft and a posterolateral corner reconstruction with use of two different methods, with a comparison of clinical outcomes in the two groups.

Methods: Our study included forty-six patients who had undergone posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with use of an Achilles tendon-bone allograft and posterolateral corner reconstruction with either anatomical reconstruction of the lateral collateral ligament and popliteus tendon with use of a tibialis posterior tendon allograft (twenty-one patients; Group A) or the modified biceps rerouting tenodesis (twenty-five patients; Group B) in an alternating fashion. Patients were assessed for knee instability with use of the dial test at 30° and 90°, together with varus and posterior stress radiography.

Results: At the two-year follow-up evaluation, although no significant difference was found on posterior stress radiography (mean and standard error, 5.7 ± 0.4 mm for Group A compared with 4.8 ± 0.4 mm for Group B), Group A showed more improvement than Group B on the dial test (16° ± 1° vs. 13° ± 1° at 30° and 17° ± 1° vs. 14° ± 1° at 90°; p = 0.001 for both) and varus stress radiography (3.6 ± 0.3 mm vs. 2.6 ± 0.3 mm; p = 0.024), in the Lysholm (29.5 ± 2.4 vs. 22.3 ± 2.3; p = 0.037) and the International Knee Documentation Committee knee scores (p = 0.041), and less terminal flexion loss (4.0° ± 1.2° vs. 8.8° ± 1.3°; p = 0.013).

Conclusions: Combined with posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, anatomical posterolateral corner reconstruction of the popliteus tendon and lateral collateral ligament showed better outcomes compared with the modified biceps rerouting tenodesis, although the mean differences of varus and external rotatory stability between the groups were relatively small. However, the overall difference might have been reduced by the negative value caused by overcorrection in Group B. This study demonstrated that anatomical posterolateral corner reconstruction is a reliable alternative method in addressing posterolateral corner and posterior cruciate ligament insufficiency of the knee, a finding that ideally should be tested in a randomized controlled trial.

TI  - Tegner level is predictive for successful return to sport 2 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2020
AB  - For a successful return to sport (RTS) after an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), patients are recommended to attend a comprehensive rehabilitation program, followed by an RTS assessment, that is a combination of tests. The purpose of this study was to predict a successful return to sport using the results of the RTS assessment and self-reported questionnaires at minimum 2 years after ACLR. A total of 123 consecutive ACLR patients undertook an intensive rehabilitation program followed by a comprehensive RTS assessment that included an established combination of balance and strength tests, the ACL-return to sport after Injury scale (ACL-RSI) questionnaire and a KT1000 laximetry test. Preinjury and expected Tegner and Lysholm were collected at baseline, at RTS and prospectively collected at minimum 2-year follow-up. The patients were asked if they returned to their previous sport and at which level. All variables were included in a regression analysis predicting a successful return to previous sport, return to the same level of sport as well as the Tegner level at 2 years. Sixty-two patients (50%) returned to their previous sport by the 2-year follow-up, without a difference in preinjury Tegner between these two groups (n.s.). Expected preoperative Tegner was the only significant predictor of a successful return to previous sport (p = 0.042; OR 1.300, 95% CI 1.010–1.672). Out of the 62 patients returning to their previous sport, 38 (61%) reported to be on the same or higher level. The only predictive variable for returning to the same level was the higher preinjury Tegner level (p = 0.048; OR 1.522). Multivariate regression analysis of Tegner level at 2 years found younger age to be the only predictive value. From the RTS assessment tests, the ACL-RSI questionnaire and the posterolateral balance test were predictive variables for Tegner at 2-year follow-up, albeit in the univariate regression analysis. Preoperative Tegner and expected Tegner level collected prior to an ACL reconstruction can aid in the objective prediction of patients’ return to sport after 2 years. High-level athletes are more likely to return to their previous sport and to the previous level. Younger patients achieve a higher Tegner level at 2 years. Level III study.

TI  - Arthroscopically Assisted Cannulated Screw Fixation for Treating Type III Tibial Intercondylar Eminence Fractures: A Short-Term Retrospective Controlled Study.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background: This study presents the clinical results from 22 children who underwent minimally invasive arthroscopically assisted screw fixation for the treatment of intercondylar eminence fractures. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 22 children (aged 7.5 to 13.5 years) with type III tibial intercondylar eminence fractures who were treated in our department from March 2007 to September 2019. According to the type of operation, the patients were divided into two groups: group A (n = 12) received arthroscopically assisted cannulated screw fixation, and group B (n = 10) received open reduction and cannulated screw internal fixation. Radiography scans, Lysholm scores, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2,000 subjective scores, Tegner scores, range of motion (ROM) of the knee, the anterior drawer test (ADT), the Lachman test, and the pivot-shift test were used to evaluate the clinical efficacy. Results: All 22 children were evaluated over a 12 to 58 month follow-up period (mean: 27.5 months). At the final exam, group A was significantly superior to group B in Lysholm scores (93.33 ± 3.55 vs. 86.20 ± 4.52), IKDC scores (92.06 ± 3.55 vs. 86.07 ± 5.81), and Tegner scores (7.75 ± 0.87 vs. 6.40 ± 0.52) and presented shorter operative times (25.42 ± 3.97 vs. 35.00 ± 5.27). The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). All the incisions healed primarily. No complications, such as fracture fragment displacement, delayed epiphyseal growth, or knee joint dysfunction, were observed. The drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were negative for all patients. Conclusions: Arthroscopically assisted cannulated screw fixation is effective and safe for the treatment of tibial intercondylar eminence fractures, providing excellent stability and quick recovery of joint function.

TI  - Posterior Cruciate Ligament Tibial Avulsion treated with Open Reduction and Internal Fixation through the Burks and Schaffer Approach.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Objective: To report functional outcome in Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) tibial avulsion fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation through Burks and Schaffer approach. The patient specific functional outcome measures like IKDC grading together with objective grading with stress radiographs have rarely been used -to assess PCL tibial avulsion fractures.

Material and Methods: Twenty seven patients (21 males and 6 females) were included in the study. The mean follow up duration was 22.30±6.82 months. They were assessed using international knee documentation committee (IKDC) grades, Lysholm scoring and stress radiography. The injury severity scores (ISS) of the patients were also recorded.

Results: The mean Lysholm scores at the time of last follow up was 90.85±5.58. The IKDC grades achieved were normal in 20 patients, near normal in five and abnormal in two. The PCL laxity determined on active hamstring contraction stress radiography was grade I in 20 cases and grade II in seven cases. All patients had achieved bony union of tibial avulsion fractures at the time of last follow up. Statistically significant association was found between higher ISS and lower Lysholm scores. (t=3.455, p=0.0019). Good IKDC grades were associated with higher Lysholm scores (analysis of variance, F=32.51, p<.0001). There was no correlation between PCL laxity and functional outcome (t=.857, p = 0.399).

Conclusion: PCL tibial avulsion fractures treated through Burk and Schaffer approach with open reduction and internal fixation produces good results. The early rehabilitation without cast immobilisation prevents arthrofibrosis.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes of Combined Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis and Intra-articular Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Addressing High-Grade Pivot-Shift Phenomenon
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the clinical outcomes of combined lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) and intra-articular anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) in addressing the high-grade pivot-shift phenomenon. Methods The PubMed/Medline database was searched for articles reporting clinical outcomes of combined LET and intra-articular ACLR in treating ACL injuries with high-grade pivot shift. High-grade pivot shift was defined as the presence of moderate to severe rotational instability shown by a grade II or III manual pivot shift preoperatively (grade 0, normal; grade I, glide; grade II, clunk; and grade III, locking, according to International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] form). The postoperative manual pivot-shift grading during the clinical follow-up visit was the primary outcome variable. Moreover, the prevalence of residual pivot shift (grade I, II, or III), distribution of objective IKDC scores, and anterior knee stability were also compared between patients with and without an additional LET procedure. Results Seven studies were included. Overall, 326 patients (326 knees) with high-grade pivot shift underwent combined LET and intra-articular ACLR with a mean follow-up period of 46.2 months (range, 24 to 76 months). There were 274 patients (84.1%) with grade 0, 42 (12.9%) with grade I, and 10 (3.0%) with grade II pivot shift at the final follow-up. Among the 5 comparative studies, the prevalence of residual pivot shift was significantly lower ( P Conclusions The combination of LET and intra-articular ACLR was effective in eliminating the high-grade pivot-shift phenomenon. For ACL injuries with high-grade pivot shift, LET plus ACLR provided a significant reduction in the prevalence of residual pivot shift but no differences in objective IKDC scores and anterior knee stability compared with isolated ACLR at short-term follow-up.

TI  - Knee stability after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in patients older than forty years: comparison between different age groups
PY  - 2013
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare clinical and arthrometrical results of a series of patients older than 40 years with those of younger patients following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The hypothesis of this study was that certain biological and biomechanical factors related to middle-aged patients, ACL reconstruction would provide different results compared with younger patients. Thirty-six patients >40 years operated for ACL reconstruction between 2002 and 2010 were selected for this retrospective study, and results were compared with patients in two other age groups ( 40 years, 2.7 mm (SD 1.8) for patients aged 30–40 years and 2.6 mm (SD 1.8) for patients 40 years. Moreover, in that group, greater knee stability was found when compared with the younger patient groups.

TI  - Avulsion Fracture of the Lateral Ankle Ligament Complex in Severe Inversion Injury Incidence and Clinical Outcome
PY  - 2007
AB  - BackgroundAvulsion fracture of the lateral ankle ligaments is often undetected on early radiographs. The epidemiology and treatment of such avulsion fractures have received much less attention than the epidemiology and treatment of rupture of these ligaments.HypothesisThe clinical characteristics of avulsion fracture are different from those of ligament rupture. Unlike nonoperative treatment of lateral ligament rupture, nonoperative treatment of avulsion fracture does not yield satisfactory results.Study DesignCohort study; Level of evidence, 2.MethodsA total of 169 consecutive patients with severe inversion injury were classified into a ligament rupture group or avulsion fracture group on the basis of physical examination findings and anterior talofibular ligament and calcaneofibular ligament radiographic views. Age, sex, activity level, and the mechanism of injury were analyzed. Patients in both groups were treated by casting. Follow-up examination of 152 patients included clinical assessment and functi...

TI  - Analysis of Irradiation on the Clinical Effectiveness of Allogenic Tissue When Used for Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background:It is unclear whether the use of low-dose irradiation or other tissue-processing methods, such as preservation by fresh-frozen (FF), freeze-drying (FD), or cryopreservation (CP) methods, affects the clinical outcomes of primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using allograft.Hypothesis:Low-dose gamma irradiation (<2.5 Mrad) and method of allograft preservation do not affect subjective and objective clinical outcomes after primary ACLR in studies reviewed between November 2010 and September 2012.Study Design:Systematic review; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:A computerized search of multiple electronic databases was conducted from November 2010 to September 2012 for prospective and retrospective studies involving primary allograft ACLR. Inclusion criteria were English-language publications with a minimum average of 2 years’ follow-up. Studies were excluded if they involved revision surgery, open surgery, multiple ligament procedures, autograft, xenograft, meniscal allograft, skelet...

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Injured Knees With Meniscal Ramp Lesions Manifest Greater Anteroposterior and Rotatory Instability Compared With Isolated Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Injured Knees.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To investigate the effects of ramp lesion (RL) and its repair on knee instability in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury by quantitatively assessing anteroposterior and rotational knee instability before and after ACL reconstruction.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">All primary double-bundle ACL reconstructions using hamstring autografts between 2016 and 2021 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients with RLs without other meniscal injuries were included in group R, whereas those with isolated ACL injuries constituted group C. RL was repaired using all-inside devices in all patients in group R. Knee instability, including the amount of anterior tibial translation (ATT), and the acceleration and external rotational angular velocity of the knee joint (ERAV) during the pivot-shift test were assessed at the time of surgery. The pivot-shift test grade was recorded.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 73 patients were included in this study. Preoperatively, group R (n = 23) had significantly greater pivot-shift grades (P = .039), ATT (6.0 mm, group R; 4.5 mm, group C, P &lt; .001), acceleration (6.8, 2.8; P = .037), and ERAV (3.9, 2.8; P = .001) than group C (n = 50). Intraoperatively, ATT (-1.0 mm, -1.0 mm; P &lt; .001), acceleration (1.2, 1.1; P &lt; .001), and ERAV (1.4, 1.2; P &lt; .001) were significantly decreased compared with the preoperative values in both groups. No significant differences in these values were observed between groups R and C.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">ACL-injured knees accompanied by RLs exhibited significantly greater anteroposterior and rotatory instability than knees with isolated ACL injuries; increased knee instability can be effectively addressed by performing RL repair in conjunction with ACL reconstruction. The quantitative assessments employed-specifically measuring ATT, acceleration, and ERAV during the pivot-shift test-have allowed us to delineate these aspects of knee instability with greater precision.</AbstractText>

TI  - Simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and dome-shaped high tibial osteotomy for severe medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Background The optimal surgical procedure to address both anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency and medial compartment osteoarthritis (OA) has been controversial. Case report A 49-year-old woman with a 30-year history of chronic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency, medial compartment osteoarthritis, and varus deformity presented with medial knee pain and apprehension with walking and playing soccer. Her preoperative range of motion was from 0° of extension to 135° of flexion. The anterior drawer sign (1+), Lachman test (1+), and pivot shift test (glide) were positive before surgery, as measured by the International Knee Documentation Committee knee examination form. The patient underwent simultaneous arthroscopic ACL single-socket and single-bundle reconstruction using hamstring tendons, dome-shaped high tibial osteotomy using the TomoFix fixation device, and mosaicplasty to the medial condyle. The standing femorotibial angle changed from 185° preoperatively to 172° postoperatively. Range of motion exercises were started 1 week after surgery, and partial weight bearing was allowed 2 weeks after surgery. The patient returned to her baseline physical level 2 years after the operation. Range of motion was –10° of extension and 130° of flexion, and the anterior drawer sign, Lachman test, and pivot shift test were all negative at the final 3-year follow-up. Conclusion An ACL reconstruction combined with a dome-shaped high tibial osteotomy using a locking plate is one option for treating an aged athlete with ACL deficiency and severe medial compartment osteoarthritis, and can allow the athlete to return to sports activity.

TI  - Meniscal Repair of Degenerative Horizontal Cleavage Tears Using Fibrin Clots
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: Presently, the treatment options available for patients with horizontal degenerative cleavage tears of the meniscus are limited. These tears are considered an indication for partial or subtotal meniscectomy because when the tear is located within an avascular area, it is difficult to induce healing. However, meniscectomy is not ideal because it disrupts the normal anatomical structure and function of the meniscus.

TI  - Reconstruction for Chronic ACL Tears with or without Anterolateral Structure Augmentation in Patients at High Risk for Clinical Failure: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background The purpose of this trial was to determine whether anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with anterolateral structure augmentation (ALSA) would result in better clinical outcomes in patients with a high risk of clinical failure. Methods From February 2017 to June 2018, 120 young, active adults with chronic anterior cruciate ligament injury and high risk of clinical failure were randomized. The patients were followed for >2 years, with 5 being lost to follow-up and 1 being withdrawn from the study. Clinical characteristics, operative findings, and postoperative clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results The analysis included data from 114 patients, including 95 men and 19 women with a mean age (and standard deviation) of 30.1 ± 6.7 years in the ACLR group and 30.1 ± 6.4 years in the ALSA group. The rate of clinical failure was 20.4% (11 of 54 patients) and 3.3% (2 of 60 patients) in the ACLR and ALSA groups, respectively (difference, 17.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3% to 29.8%; p = 0.007). Significantly higher rates of return to the preinjury level of sports (48.3% versus 27.8%; difference, 20.5%; 95% CI, 2.7% to 36.6%; p = 0.024) and to a competitive level of play (63.3% versus 42.6%; difference, 22.3%; 95% CI, 4.1% to 38.8%; p = 0.027) was found in the ALSA group. Conclusions Compared with isolated ACLR, combined ACLR and ALSA resulted in a reduction in persistent rotatory laxity and higher rates of return to preinjury and competitive levels of play at 2 years of follow-up in the population studied. Our study suggests that patients with high risk of clinical failure appear to be candidates for the ALSA approach. Level of evidence Therapeutic Level I.

TI  - Methods for evaluating effects of unloader knee braces on joint health: a review.
PY  - 2019
AB  - The paper aims to provide a state-of-the-art review of methods for evaluating the effectiveness and effect of unloader knee braces on the knee joint and discuss their limitations and future directions. Unloader braces are prescribed as a non-pharmacological conservative treatment option for patients with medial knee osteoarthritis to provide relief in terms of pain reduction, returning to regular physical activities, and enhancing the quality of life. Methods used to evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of these devices on patients’ health are categorized into three broad categories (perception-, biochemical-, and morphology-based), depending upon the process and tools used. The main focus of these methods is on the short-term clinical outcome (pain or unloading efficiency). There is a significant technical, research, and clinical literature gap in understanding the short- and long-term consequences of these braces on the tissues in the knee joint, including the cartilage and ligaments. Future research directions may complement existing methods with advanced quantitative imaging (morphological, biochemical, and molecular) and numerical simulation are discussed as they offer potential in assessing long-term and post-bracing effects on the knee joint.

TI  - Transtibial technique versus two incisions in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: tunnel positioning, isometricity and functional evaluation
PY  - 2016
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the transtibial and two-incision techniques for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using a single band. METHODS: A prospective and randomized study was conducted in blocks. Patients underwent ACL reconstruction by means of two techniques: transtibial (group 1: 20 patients) or two incisions (group 2: 20 patients). The radiographic positioning of the tunnel, inclination of the graft, graft isometricity and functional results (IKDC and Lysholm) were evaluated. RESULTS: The positioning of the femoral tunnel on the anteroposterior radiograph, expressed as a mean percentage relative to the medial border of the tibial plateau, was 54.6% in group 1 and 60.8% in group 2 (p 0.05). Group 2 had better results from the pivot-shift maneuver (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The technique of two incisions allowed positioning of the femoral tunnel that was more lateralized and anteriorized, such that the graft was more inclined and there was a clinically better result from the pivot-shift maneuver. There was no difference in isometricity and no final functional result over the short follow-up time evaluated.

TI  - A novel test for assessment of anterolateral rotatory instability of the knee: the tibial internal rotation test (TIR test)
PY  - 2018
AB  - Rotational instability of the knee may persist after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, which may be due to insufficiency of anterolateral stabilizing structures. However, no reliable diagnostic tool or physical examination test is available for identifying patients with anterolateral rotatory instability (ALRI). As shown in cadaveric studies, static internal rotation of the knee is increased in higher flexion angles of the knee after severing the anterolateral structures. This might also be the case in patients with an ACL-deficient knee and concomitant damage to the anterolateral structures. The objective of this study is to assess anterolateral rotatory instability of the knee during physical examination with a tibial internal rotation test. ACL-injured knees of 52 patients were examined by two examiners and side-to-side differences were compared. Both lower legs were internally rotated by applying manual internal rotation torque to both feet in prone position with the knees in 30°, 60° and 90° of flexion. For quantification of the amount of rotation in degrees, a torque adapter on a booth was used. Intra-rater, inter-rater and rater-device agreement were determined by calculating kappa (κ) for the tibial internal rotation test. Tibial internal rotation is increased in 19.2% of the patients with ACL injury according to the tibial internal rotation test. Good intra-rater agreement was found for the tibial internal rotation test, κC = 0.63 (95%CI -0.02-1.28), p = 0.015. Fair inter-rater agreement was found, κF = 0.29 (95%CI 0.02–0.57), p = 0.038. Good rater-device agreement was found, κC = 0.62 (95%CI 0.15–1.10), p = 0.001. The tibial internal rotation test shows increased tibial internal rotation in a small amount of patients with ACL injury. Even though no gold standard for assessment of increased tibial internal rotation of the knee is available yet, the test can be of additional value. It can be used for assessment of internal rotatory laxity of the knee as part of ALRI in addition to the pivot shift test. No clinical implications should yet be based on this test alone.

AB  - Summary – In order to prevent anterior cruciate ligament injuries it is necessary to define risk factors and to analyze the most frequent causes of injuries – that being the aim of this study. The study sample consisted of 451 surgically treated patients, including 400 sportsmen (65% of them being active and 35% recreational sportsmen), 29% female and 71% male; of whom 90% were younger than 35. Sports injuries, as the most frequent cause of anterior cruciate ligament injuries, were recorded in 88% of patients (non-contact ones in 78% and contact ones in 22%), injuries occurring in everyday activities in 11% and in traffic in 1%. Among sportsmen, reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament was most frequently performed in football players (48%), then in handball players (22%), basketball players (13%), volleyball players (8%), martial arts fighters (4%). However, the injury incidence was the highest among the active basketball players (1 injured among 91 active players). Type of footwear, warming up before the activity, genetic predisposition and everyday therapy did not have a significant influence on getting injured. Anterior cruciate ligament injuries happened three times more often during matches, in the middle and at the end of a match and training session (79%), at landing after the jump or when changing direction of movement (75%) without a contact with other competitors, on dry surfaces (79%), among not so well prepared sportsmen.

TI  - Surgical Management of Traumatic Knee Dislocation
PY  - 2007
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate our method of surgical treatment of traumatic knee dislocation, by use of a standardized protocol, and to report our clinical results. Methods: Thirty-six consecutive patients presented with a grossly dislocated or reduced knee. Ten of these patients were not included in this series. Five had vascular or neurovascular injury. Three had open fracture dislocation, and two had associated severe injury. The remaining 26 patients were treated by primary arthroscopic reconstruction with autologous grafting of the anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, and collateral ligaments. The anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament were reconstructed via the gracilis and semitendinosus tendons of the uninjured and injured limbs. The collateral ligaments were reconstructed via artificial ligaments (LARS Ligament; J. K. Orthomedic, Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Quebec, Canada). Of the 26 patients, 20 returned for subjective and objective evaluation at a minimum of 24 months after the operation. Early mobilization via a continuous passive motion machine and active exercise were started on the fourth day postoperatively. Results: At a mean follow-up of 43 months, the mean Lysholm score was 91 points, the mean score on the survey of daily activities was 90 points, and the sports activities score on the Knee Outcome Survey averaged 86 points. On the basis of the rating of Meyers et al., the results were excellent in 5 patients, good in 12, fair in 2, and poor in 1. The final International Knee Documentation Committee rating was not normal in any knee, nearly normal in 9, abnormal in 9, and severely abnormal in 2. The mean loss of extension was 0° to 2°, and the mean loss of flexion was 10° to 15°. Conclusions: By use of the described method of arthroscopic-assisted reconstruction of the cruciate ligaments and repair or reconstruction of the collateral ligament and other injured structures, 45% of the patients had good subjective results and functional stability and 45% had satisfactory subjective and functional stability within 2 to 3 weeks after surgery. According to the International Knee Documentation Committee scale, 45% of knees were nearly normal, 45% were abnormal, and 10% were severely abnormal. No patient’s rating returned to normal. Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic case series. Key Words: Knee dislocation—Cruciate ligaments—Collateral ligaments— Autologous graft.

TI  - All-Cause Failure Rates Increase with Time Following Meniscal Repair Despite Favorable Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this review is to perform a meta-analysis of studies reporting meniscus repair outcomes. Pooled analyses of such studies will provide an accurate estimate of the outcomes that can be expected following meniscal repair at various postoperative time points. Methods A meta-analysis of meniscal repair failure (defined as persistent symptoms, lack of healing on magnetic resonance imaging or revision surgery) and other clinical outcomes was performed following meniscal repair. Patients included had traumatic, nondegenerative meniscal tears, were skeletally mature, and had specific time-points after surgery. Repairs included were performed either in isolation, or with concomitant ACL reconstruction. Because of the inherent heterogeneity of single-arm meta-analyses, pooled analyses were performed using a random-effects model. Results Rates of all-cause meniscal repair failure was pooled to be 12% at 0-1 years (95% CI: .09-.16), 15% at 2-3 years (95% CI: .11-.20), and 19% at 4-6 years (95% CI: .13-.24). Sensitivity analysis for studies performing meniscal repair entirely on patients with concomitant ACL reconstruction (ACLR) showed comparable rates of failure at similar time intervals. Development of osteoarthritis, in patients with knees previously free from articular pathologies, was 4% at 2-3 years (95% CI: .02-.07), and 10% at 4-6 years (95% CI: .03-.25). Conclusion Meniscus repair for traumatic injuries have an all-cause failure rate that increases from 12% to 19% through a time period ranging from 1-6 years following surgery. The failure rates were comparable for patients with meniscal repairs performed with concomitant ACLRs. Level of Evidence IV; Systematic Review of Level II-IV Studies.

TI  - Initiating a multisubspecialty orthopaedic outcomes program and utilizing the data to guide practice.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Evidence-based medicine integrates research findings, clinical expertise, and patient values to provide the highest quality patient care. An orthopaedic outcomes database can assist surgeons in assessing associations between surgical procedures, function, survivorship, complication rates, patient satisfaction, and quality of life as guidance for practice. Outcomes are used to validate techniques or procedures, to benchmark best practices, and to identify areas requiring more clinical research. Tracking the success and failure rates of implants and surgical procedures is important. An outcomes database allows for short-term, midterm, and long-term prospective follow-up studies of specific cohorts and also facilitates studies that are retrospective in design.

Several countries have initiated orthopaedic outcomes registries or databases. The oldest registry is the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register that was started in 19751. Other countries have followed with the development of their own joint registries in England, New Zealand, Germany, Finland, Denmark, and Norway2-7.

In 1994, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) attempted to create an outcomes evaluation system. The Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management System did not come to fruition and was terminated in 2000. The attempt was made to collect information on patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty or spine surgery. Difficulties were multifactorial, but were mainly due to inadequate data, record-keeping, or follow-up, which made cleaning the data to extract useful information impossible8.

Although the United States lacks a national orthopaedic registry, several institutions have developed their own databases. For example, Mayo Clinic initiated a database in 1969 that included over 56,000 joint arthroplasties by 19979. The Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute has over two decades' worth of hip and knee arthroplasty outcomes in its database10, while the Center for Hip and Knee Surgery in Indiana11, the Hospital for Special …

TI  - Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)--development of a self-administered outcome measure
PY  - 1998
AB  - There is broad consensus that good outcome measures are needed to distinguish interventions that are effective from those that are not. This task requires standardized, patient- centered measures that can be administered at a low cost. We developed a questionnaire to assess short- and long-term patient-relevant outcomes following knee injury, based on the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index, a literature review, an expert panel, and a pilot study. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is self-administered and assesses five outcomes: pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreation function, and knee-related quality of life. In this clinical study, the KOOS proved reliable, responsive to surgery and physical therapy, and valid for patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The KOOS meets basic criteria of outcome measures and can be used to evaluate the course of knee injury and treatment outcome.

TI  - Comparative study on meniscus allograft transplantation versus meniscectomy: Four years? follow-up
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background: The purpose of the present study was to compare the mid-term clinical outcomes of MAT and meniscectomy.
Methods: Between July 2006 and December 2010, 20 patients receiving meniscus allograft transplantation were enrolled. The IKDC score, Lysholm score, Tegner score and VAS score were compared between the two groups. X-ray and MRI were used to evaluate the degree of knee joint degeneration and the chondral lesions.
Results: The follow-up durations of the two groups were 60.3 ± 21.3 months and 56.5 ± 19.7 months respectively. There were no significant differences in preoperative IKDC score, Lysholm score, Tegner score and VAS score, as well as in postoperative clinical scores, single leg jumping, changes of the joint space and alignment between the two groups. Pre-post cartilage degeneration on X-ray in transplantation group was less than in meniscectomy group (1.45 (1.0-2.0) vs. 0.2 (0.0-1.0), P<0.001), as well as the postoperative Yulish score (1.3 (0.0-3.0) vs. 2.1 (1.0-3.0), P=0.027) and the pre-post Yulish score changes on MRI (0.6 (0.0-2.0) vs. 1.5 (0.0-2.0), P<0.001.
Conclusions: Though the mid-term clinical results of the two groups were similar. MAT could more obviously protect articular cartilage and delay the recessive process of articular cartilage compared with meniscectomy.

TI  - Quantifying the “Feel” of the Pivot Shift
PY  - 2016
AB  - This chapter aims to analyze the state-of-the-art technology in quantifying the “feel” related to the pivot shift phenomenon. Therefore, the presented concepts are used to support this “feel” rationale, which is mainly associated with the sudden reduction that happens after joint subluxation. All of the presented methods are related to the possibility of measuring the “clunk” that can be felt within the knee joint associated to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Scientific literature has reported the use of specific parameters – such as velocity and acceleration – that are related to the dynamic nature of the pivot shift phenomenon and also introduced the use of different devices and systems that are able to directly measure both velocity and acceleration. Due to the possibility of being used in a clinical setting, inertial sensors are playing an increasing role in this context.

TI  - High Satisfaction Yet Decreased Activity 4 Years After Transphyseal ACL Reconstruction
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background
ACL injuries in preteens and teens are common occurrences. Reconstruction is believed to be optimum treatment for those wishing to return to running, cutting, and jumping sports. Rates of reoperation, satisfaction, and long-term return to and maintenance of preinjury activity after ACL reconstruction in young athletes are important information for physicians, patients, and parents.

TI  - Delayed Surgery, Low Presurgery Activity, and Poor Preoperative IKDC Scores Are Correlated with Lower Rates of Return to Sports after ACL Reconstruction in an Asian Population
PY  - 2021
AB  - There is limited literature regarding the early postsurgical outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in Asian populations, particularly in the rates of return to sports. We aimed to quantify early clinical outcomes for ACL reconstruction, determine the predictive value of surgeon- and patient-reported outcomes on the rate of return to sports in the early postoperative period, and identify factors predictive of return to sports. We analyzed the data of 55 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction at our tertiary medical center from 2015 to 2016. All patients underwent transportal ACL reconstruction and a standardized post-ACL reconstruction rehabilitation protocol. Patients with concurrent meniscal injury and repair were included. Patients were evaluated at the 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year postoperative periods. Surgeon- and patient-reported outcome scores were collected at each follow-up through a systematic questionnaire designed to determine the patient's level of return to sport and reasons for not returning. Surgeon- and patient-reported outcome measures improved significantly over the 2-year postoperative period (p

TI  - High incidence of superficial and deep medial collateral ligament injuries in ‘isolated’ anterior cruciate ligament ruptures: a long overlooked injury
PY  - 2021
AB  - In anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, concomitant damage to peripheral soft tissues is associated with increased rotatory instability of the knee. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence and patterns of medial collateral ligament complex injuries in patients with clinically ‘isolated’ ACL ruptures. Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction for complete ‘presumed isolated’ ACL rupture between 2015 and 2019 were retrospectively included in this study. Patient’s characteristics and intraoperative findings were retrieved from clinical and surgical documentation. Preoperative MRIs were evaluated and the grade and location of injuries to the superficial MCL (sMCL), dMCL and the posterior oblique ligament (POL) recorded. All patients were clinically assessed under anaesthesia with standard ligament laxity tests. Hundred patients with a mean age of 22.3 ± 4.9 years were included. The incidence of concomitant MCL complex injuries was 67%. sMCL injuries occurred in 62%, dMCL in 31% and POL in 11% with various injury patterns. A dMCL injury was significantly associated with MRI grade II sMCL injuries, medial meniscus ‘ramp’ lesions seen at surgery and bone oedema at the medial femoral condyle (MFC) adjacent to the dMCL attachment site (p < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis identified younger age (OR 1.2, p < 0.05), simultaneous sMCL injury (OR 6.75, p < 0.01) and the presence of bone oedema at the MFC adjacent to the dMCL attachment site (OR 5.54, p < 0.01) as predictive factors for a dMCL injury. The incidence of combined ACL and medial ligament complex injuries is high. Lesions of the dMCL were associated with ramp lesions, MFC bone oedema close to the dMCL attachment, and sMCL injury. Missed AMRI is a risk factor for ACL graft failure from overload and, hence, oedema in the MCL (especially dMCL) demands careful assessment for AMRI, even in the knee lacking excess valgus laxity. This study provides information about specific MCL injury patterns including the dMCL in ACL ruptures and will allow surgeons to initiate individualised treatment. III.

PY  - 2011
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the questionnaire Scoring of Patellofemoral Disorders for the Portuguese language. METHODS: 40 participants were selected, including physiotherapists and lay individuals. The process of translating the questionnaire into Portuguese was based on standardized methods. The original scale passed through seven stages, before reaching the final version in Portuguese. 40 subjects took part in each test: 20 lay individuals and 20 physiotherapists. The level acceptable of non-comprehension was up to 10% of the interviewees. RESULTS: In the first test, only three questions were not understood by more than 10% of the subjects interviewed, leading to a reapplication of the questionnaire. In the second test, only two questions were understood by 90% of the interviewees, while the remaining question were understood by more than 90% of the interviewees, and there were no doubts among the physiotherapists. The 2nd version of the test was therefore selected as the final Portuguese version of Scoring of Patellofemoral Disorders. CONCLUSION: The Scoring of Patellofemoral Disorders scale was translated and adapted culturally for the Portuguese language, with title, in Portuguese, of Escala de Desordens Patelofemorais. Level of Evidence: Level II, development of diagnostic criteria on consecutive patients.

TI  - Cross-cultural comparison of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction in the United States and Norway
PY  - 2009
AB  - Data from large prospectively collected anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) cohorts are being utilized to address clinical questions regarding ACL injury demographics and outcomes of ACL reconstruction. These data are affected by patient and injury factors as well as surgical factors associated with the site of data collection. The aim of this article is to compare primary ACL reconstruction data from patient cohorts in the United States and Norway, demonstrating the similarities and differences between two large cohorts. Primary ACL reconstruction data from the Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) in the United States and the Norwegian National Knee Ligament Registry (NKLR) were compared to identify similarities and differences in patient demographics, activity at injury, preoperative Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), time to reconstruction, intraarticular pathology, and graft choice. Seven hundred and thirteen patients from the MOON cohort were compared with 4,928 patients from the NKLR. A higher percentage of males (NKLR 57%, MOON 52%; P < 0.01) and increased patient age (NKLR 27 years, MOON 23 years; P\0.001) were noted in the NKLR population. The most common sports associated with injury in the MOON cohort were basketball (20%), soccer (17%), and American football (14%); while soccer (42%), handball (26%), and downhill skiing (10%) were most common in the NKLR. Median time to reconstruction was 2.4 (Interquartile range [IQR] 1.2-7.2) months in the MOON cohort and 7.9 (IQR 4.2-17.8) months in the NKLR cohort (P < 0.001). Both meniscal tears (MOON 65%, NKLR 48%; P < 0.001) and articular cartilage defects (MOON 46%, NKLR 26%; P < 0.001) were more common in the MOON cohort. Hamstring autografts (MOON 44%, NKLR 63%) and patellar tendon autografts (MOON 42%, NKLR 37%) were commonly utilized in both cohorts. Allografts were much more frequently utilized in the MOON cohort (MOON 13%, NKLR 0.04%; P < 0.001). Significant diversity in patient, injury, and surgical factors exist among large prospective cohorts collected in different locations. Surgeons should investigate and consider the characteristics of these cohorts when applying knowledge gleaned from these groups to their own patient populations.

TI  - A Robust System for Longitudinal Knee Joint Edema and Blood Flow Assessment Based on Vector Bioimpedance Measurements
PY  - 2015
AB  - We present a robust vector bioimpedance measurement system for longitudinal knee joint health assessment, capable of acquiring high resolution static (slowly varying over the course of hours to days) and dynamic (rapidly varying on the order of milli-seconds) bioresistance and bioreactance signals. Occupying an area of $78\times 90\ {\rm mm}^{2}$ and consuming 0.25 W when supplied with $\pm$ 5 V, the front-end achieves a dynamic range of 345 $\Omega$ and noise floor of 0.018 ${\rm m}\Omega_{\rm rms}$ (resistive) and 0.055 ${\rm m}\Omega_{\rm rms}$ (reactive) within a bandwidth of 0.1–20 Hz. A microcontroller allows real-time calibration to minimize errors due to environmental variability (e.g., temperature) that can be experienced outside of lab environments, and enables data storage on a micro secure digital card. The acquired signals are then processed using customized physiology-driven algorithms to extract musculoskeletal (edema) and cardiovascular (local blood volume pulse) features from the knee joint. In a feasibility study, we found statistically significant differences $(p between the injured and contralateral static knee impedance measures for two subjects with recent unilateral knee injury compared to seven controls. Specifically, the impedance was lower for the injured knees, supporting the physiological expectations for increased edema and damaged cell membranes. In a second feasibility study, we demonstrate the sensitivity of the dynamic impedance measures with a cold-pressor test, with a 20 ${\rm m}\Omega$ decrease in the pulsatile resistance associated with increased downstream peripheral vascular resistance. The proposed system will serve as a foundation for future efforts aimed at quantifying joint health status continuously during normal daily life.

TI  - Muscle strength recovery versus semitendinosus and gracilis tendon regeneration after harvesting for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2015
AB  - Twenty consecutive, chronic and isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesions that underwent reconstruction with quadrupled semitendinosus (ST) and gracilis (G) were prospectively examined to compare tendon regeneration and muscle strength recovery. Twenty consecutive axial nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scans were done after 1 month, 6 months and 2 years from surgery. A CybexII was used to evaluate concentric strength deficits both in flexion and in internal tibia rotation at 6 months and 2 years. At 2 years, an NMR signal comparable to the contralateral was present in 14 (70%) cases and absent in 6 (30%). Semitendinosus tendon exceeded the meniscal plateau since the first month, while the G tendon crossed the joint line only after 6 months. However, the distal-end insertions of both tendons were always significantly more proximal than the contralateral normal side (ST: P = .002; G: P = .003). In case of tendon regeneration, flexion deficit was not significant after 6 months, while internal tibia rotation deficit became not significant only after 2 years. In case of non-regeneration, a flexion deficit was present after 6 months [15.5% (P = .05)] but not after 2 years, while internal tibial rotation deficit was significant both after 6 months [30.3% (P < .001)] and 2 years [24.3% (P = .03)]. In case of tendon regeneration, isokinetic evaluation showed a non-significant deficit in both flexion and internal rotation strength after ACL reconstruction with ST and G. At the 2-year follow-up, none of the 6 patients without tendon regeneration found any impairment in their sport activities despite the loss of internal rotation strength.

TI  - The efficacy of ilizarov method for management of long tibial bone and soft tissue defect.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Introduction Patients with open fracture Gustillo-Anderson grade 3 had undergone several surgical procedures, but still ended up with expose long dead bone or infected. Illizarov method was used to address long bone and soft tissue defect after re-debridement with radical resection of long dead bone or infected segment. Methods We included 14 patients (mean age: 30.86 ± 11.49) with non-union tibial fracture with long dead and infected bone segment who had undergone several debridement, bone grafting or spacer and soft tissue closure procedure due to open fracture of tibia grade 3. The subjects underwent re-debridement with radical resection of dead or infected bone segment followed by Illizarov method to perform bone transport procedure for bone defect filling and simultaneously restore severe soft tissue loss and bone lengthening procedure. Results All subjects had achieved satisfactory results with mean docking period of bone transport 3.78 ± 0.54 months, union time at the docking side 7 (5.5–9) months. Soft tissue was covered and no recurrence of infection. Three subjects had Leg Length Discrepancy (LLD) of 1 cm, whereas the remaining had zero discrepancy. No significant pain was observed at final follow-up and 4 patients had ankle joint stiffness. Conclusion The Illizarov method can effectively address long bone and soft tissue defects by distraction osteogenesis through bone transport procedure that filling the defect gradually without bone graft and simultaneously enhancing soft tissue closure without tertiary soft tissue procedure subsequently followed with bone lengthening procedure to correct the limb length discrepancy.

TI  - Rater agreement reliability of the dial test in the ACL-deficient knee.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Posterolateral rotatory instability (PLRI) of the knee can easily be missed, because attention is paid to injury of the cruciate ligaments. If left untreated this clinical instability may persist after reconstruction of the cruciate ligaments and may put the graft at risk of failure. Even though the dial test is widely used to diagnose PLRI, no validity and reliability studies of the manual dial test are yet performed in patients. This study focuses on the reliability of the manual dial test by determining the rater agreement. Two independent examiners performed the dial test in knees of 52 patients after knee distorsion with a suspicion on ACL rupture. The dial test was performed in prone position in 30°, 60° and 90° of flexion of the knees. ≥10° side-to-side difference was considered a positive dial test. For quantification of the amount of rotation in degrees, a measuring device was used with a standardized 6 Nm force, using a digital torque adapter on a booth. The intra-rater, inter-rater and rater-device agreement were determined by calculating kappa (κ) for the dial test. A positive dial test was found in 21.2% and 18.0% of the patients as assessed by a blinded examiner and orthopaedic surgeon respectively. Fair inter-rater agreement was found in 30° of flexion, κF = 0.29 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.56), p = 0.044 and 90° of flexion, κF = 0.38 (95% CI: 0.10 to 0.66), p = 0.007. Almost perfect rater-device agreement was found in 30° of flexion, κC = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.52 to 1.15), p < 0.001. Moderate rater-device agreement was found in 30° and 90° combined, κC = 0.50 (95% CI: 0.13 to 0.86), p = 0.008. No significant intra-rater agreement was found. Rater agreement reliability of the manual dial test is questionable. It has a fair inter-rater agreement in 30° and 90° of flexion.

TI  - Evaluation of Clinical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Results After Treatment With Casting and Bracing for the Acutely Injured Posterior Cruciate Ligament
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes of nonoperative management of acute, isolated posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries. Methods From February 2001 to January 2008, 49 consecutive patients with acute ( Results The grade of posterior instability was significantly improved from initial grades of I in 13 patients (34%) and II in 25 patients (66%) to follow-up grades of 0 in 3 patients (8%), I in 21 patients (55%), and II in 14 patients (37%) ( P = .007). The mean side-to-side difference in posterior translation measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) was initially 6.7 mm and significantly improved to 5.2 mm at the latest follow-up ( P P = .010) and KT-1000 arthrometer testing ( P = .003). Conclusions Our active, nonoperative method of casting and bracing with attached tibial supporters, which was designed to prevent posterior displacement at the knee, yielded satisfactory functional and MRI results in the majority of patients at intermediate-term follow-up. The continuity of the PCL with low signal intensity on follow-up MRI was a predictable factor for a favorable prognosis in patients with acute PCL injuries.

AB  - The pivot-shift test is the most specific physical exam to detect the ACL insufficiency and the only manual test capable to predict the knee function and the development of osteoarthrosis after an ACL reconstruction. However, the lack of a standardized maneuver for the pivot-shift test makes the interpretation subjective and dependent on examiner’s experience.

TI  - A clinically relevant assessment of posterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner injuries. Evaluation of isolated and combined deficiency.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Background: The treatment of symptomatic posterior cruciate ligament injuries of the knee is controversial. Identification of concomitant injuries of the posterolateral corner is important to optimize surgical and clinical outcomes, although this diagnosis is sometimes difficult. The purpose of this study was to determine the physical examination and stress radiography parameters of isolated injuries of the posterior cruciate ligament and combined injuries of the posterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner. Our hypothesis was that Grade-3 posterior drawer laxity is an indicator of a concomitant injury of the posterolateral corner.

Methods: Ten pairs of cadaver knees (a total of twenty knees) were evaluated with posterior drawer testing, dial testing, and stress radiography. Stress radiography was performed by applying a 200-N posterior drawer at 90° of knee flexion. The knees were tested while intact and then retested following the sequential resection of the posterior cruciate ligament followed by the posterolateral corner structures.

Results: All intact specimens were rated as Grade 0 on posterior drawer testing. Sectioning of the posterior cruciate ligament resulted in Grade-2 posterior drawer in all specimens. The additional resection of the posterolateral corner resulted in Grade-3 posterior drawer in all specimens. Dial testing of the intact knees resulted in a mean (and standard error) of 10.5° ± 1.0° and 10.5° ± 0.80° of external rotation at 30° and 90°, respectively. This increased significantly to 15.1° ± 1.1° and 16.2° ± 0.89°, respectively, following sectioning of the posterior cruciate ligament (p < 0.05). After resection of the posterolateral corner, rotation was further increased to a mean of 21.6° ± 1.5° at 30° and 27.5° ± 1.6° at 90° (p < 0.05). On stress radiography, the average posterior displacements measured 2.9 ± 0.5 mm in the intact specimens, 12.7 ± 1.0 mm after resection of the posterior cruciate ligament, and 22.3 ± 1.6 mm after the additional resection of the posterolateral corner (p < 0.05). The corrected posterior displacement, calculated by subtracting the displacement in the intact knees, was 9.8 mm after resection of the posterior cruciate ligament and 19.4 mm after the additional resection of the posterolateral corner.

Conclusions: A grade of 3 on posterior drawer testing and >10 mm of posterior tibial translation on stress radiography correlate with the presence of a posterolateral corner injury in addition to a complete disruption of the posterior cruciate ligament.

Clinical Relevance: Detection of grade-3 posterior drawer on physical examination should alert the examiner to the presence of a posterolateral corner injury.

TI  - A new bioabsorbable interference screw: preliminary results of a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial.
PY  - 2000
AB  - Abstract Summary: A randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare a bioabsorbable polyglyconate screw (Endo-Fix; Smith & Nephew, Andover, MA) to a metal screw in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. A total of 124 patients were operated on and 113 assessed up to 1 year postoperatively. Assessments included a history and physical examination, the IKDC evaluation, and knee arthrometry measurements. No significant differences were found between the groups with respect to any of the IKDC problem areas at 1 year. The IKDC final evaluation was normal or nearly normal in 92% of polyglyconate patients and 90% of controls. The incidence of postoperative complications was similar in the 2 groups. One polyglyconate patient developed a subcutaneous cyst that may have been related to breakdown of the screw. This resolved without treatment and the patient had an excellent clinical outcome. This study shows that the polyglyconate screw is an effective alternative to metal in endoscopic reconstruction of the ACL.

TI  - Clinical outcome of arthroscopic fixation of anterior tibial eminence avulsion fractures in skeletally mature patients: a comparison of suture and screw fixation technique.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background Extreme tensile force to the anterior cruciate ligament results in an avulsion of the tibial eminence and it was believed to be more common in skeletally immature adolescent than adult. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical results of both screw and suture fixation for surgical treatment of anterior tibial eminence fractures in skeletally mature patients. Methods A retrospective review was conducted on patients from 2002 to 2009 who sustained fractures of the anterior tibial eminence and were treated with arthroscopic-assisted fixation using either cannulated screws (25 patients) or Ethibond sutures (23 patients). Follow-up assessment included function evaluation, ligament laxity, and range of motion. Results Seventy-five percent of the anterior tibial eminence fractures resulted from traffic-related injuries in this study. Median operating time was 75 minutes in screw fixation group and 92 minutes in suture fixation group (p = 0.006). The objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) results for patients were 23 A, 2 B, and no C or D in screw fixation group and 16 A, 4 B, 3 C, and no D (p = 0.040) in suture fixation group. The KT-1000 side-to-side difference was greater than 5 mm in two patients (8%) in the screw fixation group and in three patients (13%) in the suture fixation group (p = 0.058). Among patients in screw fixation group, two (8%) patients had grade 1 pivot shift and 2 (8%) patients had grade 2 pivot shift. Among patients in suture fixation group, five (22%) patients had grade 1 pivot shift, three (13%) patients had grade 2 pivot shift, and 1 (9%) patient had grade 3 pivot shift (p = 0.037). Conclusions Significant better IKDC objective evaluation, lower glide pivot shift phenomenon, and shorter operating time requirement in screw fixation group with respect to suture fixation group were shown in our study although the other functional knee scores (Lysholm score, Tegner activity level, and the IKDC subjective score) and KT-1000 manual side-to-side difference only revealed a trend with better clinical results in screw fixation group than in suture fixation group rather than significant difference.

TI  - Reconstruction of Osteochondral Defects by Combined Bone Grafting and a Bilayer Collagen Membrane as a Sandwich Technique
PY  - 2013
AB  - Treatment of osteochondral lesions of the knee remains a major challenge in orthopedic surgery. Recently established procedures like autologous chondrocyte implantation or matrix-associated chondrocyte implantation yield good results, but include the disadvantage of two-step procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcome of repairs of osteochondral defects of the knee by a combined procedure of bone grafting and covering with a bilayer collagen membrane in a sandwich technique. Seven male patients with a mean age of 42 (range 30-55) years and symptomatic focal osteochondral lesions of the knee grade IV according to the International Cartilage Repair Society classification were included. The mean diameter of defects was 28.6 (range 15-40) mm. Results were evaluated at a minimum of 24 months after surgery by International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm-score, visual analogue scale, and magnetic resonance imaging with specific cartilage sequences, evaluating the ICRS score and the Magnetic Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score. All patients judged the operation as successful. Among the patients available for the long-term follow-up, mean visual analogue scale value was 1.3 (range 0-3) out of 10 points. Mean International Knee Documentation Committee score was 80.8 (range 63.2-88.5) out of 100 points. Mean Lysholm score was 85 (range 55-95) out of 100 points. None of the patients had to be reoperated until today. Evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging using the MOCART score revealed a good correlation to the clinical outcome. This is the first study reporting results after reconstruction of osteochondral defects of the knee joint by bone grafting and a bilayer collagen membrane. This new method offers the advantage of a one-step-procedure and yields both good clinical and magnetic resonance findings. We conclude that this procedure can be a valuable tool to improve joint function after osteochondral defects, trauma, and in joints with local arthritic lesions.

PY  - 2017
AB  - Background:The use of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) remains limited, even though multiple studies have demonstrated success rates exceeding 75%. The procedure is perceived as invasive and technically challenging, presenting barriers to more widespread adoption.Purpose/Hypothesis:The objective of this study was to investigate whether outcomes and the failure rate of a simplified ACI technique (cs-ACI) were comparable with those of the more complicated traditional technique of a chondrocyte suspension injected under a collagen membrane (cACI). We hypothesized that the change in technique would not negatively affect outcomes.Study Design:Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:Thirty-nine patients treated with the cs-ACI technique fulfilled the inclusion requirements. A group of 45 patients treated previously with standard cACI was used as a comparison. The functional outcomes were prospectively collected both preoperatively and postoperatively at the last follow-up. Failure was defined as any...

TI  - Medial meniscal ramp lesions in ACL-injured elite athletes are strongly associated with medial collateral ligament injuries and medial tibial bone bruising on MRI.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Medial menisco-capsular separations (ramp lesions) are typically found in association with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency. They are frequently missed preoperatively due to low MRI sensitivity. The purpose of this article was to describe demographic and anatomical risk factors for ramp lesions, and to identify concomitant lesions and define their characteristics to improve diagnosis of ramp lesions on MRI. Patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction between September 2015 and April 2019 were included in this study. The presence/absence of ramp lesions was recorded in preoperative MRIs and at surgery. Patients’ characteristics and clinical findings, concomitant injuries on MRI and the posterior tibial slope were evaluated. One hundred patients (80 male, 20 female) with a mean age of 22.3 ± 4.9 years met the inclusion criteria. The incidence of ramp lesions diagnosed at surgery was 16%. Ramp lesions were strongly associated with injuries to the deep MCL (dMCL, p < 0.01), the superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL, p < 0.01), and a small medial–lateral tibial slope asymmetry (p < 0.05). There was also good correlation between ramp lesions and bone oedema in the posterior medial tibia plateau (MTP, p < 0.05) and medial femoral condyle (MFC, p < 0.05). A dMCL injury, a smaller differential medial–lateral tibial slope than usual, and the identification of a ramp lesion on MRI increases the likelihood of finding a ramp lesion at surgery. MRI sensitivity was 62.5% and the specificity was 84.5%. The presence on MRI of sMCL and/or dMCL lesions, bone oedema in the posterior MTP and MFC, and a smaller differential medial–lateral tibial slope than usual are highly associated with ramp lesions visible on MRI. Additionally, a dMCL injury, a flatter lateral tibial slope than usual, and the identification of a ramp lesion on MRI increases the likelihood of finding a ramp lesion at surgery. Knowledge of the risk factors and secondary injury signs associated with ramp lesions facilitate the diagnosis of a ramp lesion preoperatively and should raise surgeons’ suspicion of this important lesion. Diagnostic study, Level III.

TI  - Fixation of fractures of the femoral neck
PY  - 2004
AB  - We randomised 31 patients with acute tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) to receive either early (within 2 weeks) or delayed (8 to 12 weeks) reconstruction using a quadruple hamstring graft in order to determine if there was any functional advantage to early reconstruction. Outcome measures included return of knee movement, muscle dynamometry, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores and Tegner activity levels.Two cases of symptomatic deep-venous thrombosis occurred in the early group. The mean range of movement was significantly greater at two weeks in the delayed group. Quadriceps muscle power was significantly better in the delayed group at 12 weeks (p < 0.05). These trends were evident at later time points, but were not statistically significant. One patient in each group had clinically significant knee stiffness at 52 weeks. IKDC scores and Tegner activity levels were not significantly different at 52 weeks. We conclude that there is no functional advantage to be gained by e...

TI  - Clinical Outcomes After Revision Meniscus Repair
PY  - 2016
AB  - Purpose To (1) report outcomes for patients who underwent revision meniscal repair and (2) define both clinical and surgical risk factors for recurrent failure. Methods The records of all patients who underwent revision meniscal repair between 1997 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Surgical technique of primary and revision meniscus repair was detailed, and tears were characterized by type and location. Clinical examination and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Tegner scores were used to determine outcomes after revision meniscus repair. Radiographs were reviewed and graded for degenerative changes. Risk factors for failure were analyzed. Results Thirty-four patients (24 male/10 female) with an average age of 22 ± 6 years (range, 14 to 38) were included in this study. Twelve lateral menisci and 22 medial meniscal repairs were revised at mean 25 ± 20 months (range, 2 to 76) after primary repair for 11 simple, 9 bucket-handle, and 14 complex tear patterns. Twenty-one tears occurred in the red-red zone and 13 in the red-white zone. At 72 ± 56–month follow-up (range, 2 to 17 years), 7 (21%) cases had documented failure of revision repairs and underwent subsequent partial meniscectomy. Mean Tegner score for all patients was 6.2 ± 1.5 (range, 3 to 9) and IKDC score was 84.8 ± 13.1 (range, 51.7 to 100) at final follow-up. Affected side joint space on radiographs remained stable from a baseline of 4.26 ± 0.88 mm to a final of 4.01 ± 0.84 mm. Multivariable regression identified younger patient age as an independent risk factor for failed revision meniscal repair ( P  = .01). Conclusions In this study of select revision meniscus repairs, 79% of patients were pain free, without any mechanical symptoms or additional surgeries at a mean of 6 years after revision repair. Younger patients may be at higher risk of failure of the revision meniscus repair. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Standardising the clinical assessment of coronal knee laxity
PY  - 2012
AB  - Clinical laxity tests are used for assessing knee ligament injuries and for soft tissue balancing in total knee arthroplasty. This study reports the development and validation of a quantitative technique of assessing collateral knee laxity through accurate measurement of potential variables during routine clinical examination. The hypothesis was that standardisation of a clinical stress test would result in a repeatable range of laxity measurements. Non-invasive infrared tracking technology with kinematic registration of joint centres gave real-time measurement of both coronal and sagittal mechanical tibiofemoral alignment Knee flexion, moment arm and magnitude of the applied force were all measured and standardised. Three clinicians then performed six knee laxity examinations on a single volunteer using a target moment of 18 Nm. Standardised laxity measurements had small standard deviations (within 1. 1 degree) for each clinician and similar mean values between clinicians, with the valgus laxity assessment (mean of 3 degrees) being slightly more consistent than varus (means of 4 degrees or 5 degrees). The manual technique of coronal knee laxity assessment was successfully quantified and standardised, leading to a narrow range of measurements (within the accuracy of the measurement system). Minimising the subjective variables of clinical examination could improve current knowledge of soft tissue knee behaviour.

TI  - Bone mineral density in the proximal tibia and calcaneus before and after arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.
PY  - 2006
AB  - Purpose: To monitor changes in bone mineral density (BMD) of the proximal tibia and the calcaneus in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture before and after arthroscopic reconstruction of the ligament, related to clinical data. Type of Study: A 2-year prospective cohort study with assessment of patient evaluation of knee performance, clinical scoring of surgical results, and measurement of BMD in the tibia and calcaneus. Methods: Eighteen patients with a unilateral ACL rupture underwent an autogenous bone–patellar tendon–bone graft ACL reconstruction. The patients were examined before surgery and after 4, 12, and 24 months. BMD was assessed bilaterally in the proximal tibia and calcaneus using dual-photon absorptiometry and converted to a Z-score by use of BMD values from a group of healthy controls. Clinical evaluation included determination of Lysholm score, quantitative Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and the patients' self-reported highest level of activity and knee performance in sports and daily activities. Results: There were significant declines in Z-score of the proximal tibia of the operated leg during the first year after surgery, whereas there was no change in the calcaneus and contralateral leg. In the lateral tibia, the Z-score was significantly lower at 24 months follow-up, compared with both controls and the noninjured side, whereas BMD of the medial tibia had returned to near normal levels. There were significant improvements in Lysholm score, highest level of activity, and knee performance in daily activities and sports. The patients' evaluation of improvement in knee performance in sports activities at 24 months follow-up was associated with an increase in Z-score of the injured leg. Conclusions: We found a partially reversible decline in BMD of the proximal tibia after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Improvement in knee performance in sports activities was associated with an increase in BMD of the injured leg. BMD of the calcaneus remained unaffected in both legs. Level of Evidence: Level III, therapeutic case control study.

TI  - Correlation Between Knee Laxity and Graft Appearance on Magnetic Resonance Imaging After Double-Bundle Hamstring Graft Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2007
AB  - Background: In recent years, double-bundle (anteromedial bundle [AMB], posterolateral bundle [PLB]) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has developed into an accepted practical surgical procedure; therefore, its efficacy needs to be established.Hypothesis: Multiple-sliced 2-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging allows evaluation of each bundle separately. Both bundles are important for knee stability, and each bundle has a role in the prevention of knee instability. Knee laxity testing will correlate with the magnetic resonance imaging appearance of the individual graft bundles.Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.Methods: A total of 97 double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were evaluated 1 year after surgery, including side-to-side difference of KT-2000 arthrometer and pivot shift test. T2-weighted 2-dimensional magnetic resonance images were captured in the middle plane of each bundle to express magnetic resonance signals of each bundle. The magnetic resonance signa...

TI  - Does the patellar tendon normalize after harvesting its central third?: a prospective long-term MRI study.
PY  - 2004
AB  - BackgroundThe central third of the patellar tendon is the most frequently used autograft for ACL reconstruction.HypothesisThe patellar tendon at the donor site would look normal as seen on MRI 6 years after harvesting its central third.MethodsNineteen consecutive patients were included in the study. MRI examinations of the donor site were performed at 6 (5 to 10) weeks, 6 (6 to 8) months, 27 (24 to 29) months, and 71 (68 to 73) months postoperatively. The contralateral normal side was examined only on the first occasion.ResultsThe size of the donor-site gap decreased significantly (P = 0.0001) between 6 weeks and 6 years. In most patients, a thinning of the central part of the patellar tendon was still found at 6 years. The thickness of the peripheral patellar tendon was increased, compared with the contralateral healthy side, until 2 years (P = 0.003). On all occasions, the width was increased compared with the contralateral side (P< 0.015).ConclusionProspective MRI examinations revealed that the patella...

TI  - High muscle co-contraction does not result in high joint forces during gait in anterior cruciate ligament deficient knees.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The mechanism of knee osteoarthritis development after anterior cruciate ligament injuries is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate knee gait variables, muscle co-contraction indices and knee joint loading in young subjects with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency (ACLD, n = 36), versus control subjects (n = 12). A validated, electromyography-informed model was used to estimate joint loading. For the involved limb of ACLD subjects versus control, muscle co-contraction indices were higher for the medial (p = 0.018, effect size = 0.93) and lateral (p = 0.028, effect size = 0.83) agonist-antagonist muscle pairs. Despite higher muscle co-contraction, medial compartment contact force was lower for the involved limb, compared to both the uninvolved limb (mean difference = 0.39 body weight, p = 0.009, effect size = 0.70) as well as the control limb (mean difference = 0.57 body weight, p = 0.007, effect size = 1.14). Similar observations were made for total contact force. For involved versus uninvolved limb, the ACLD group demonstrated lower vertical ground reaction force (mean difference = 0.08 body weight, p = 0.010, effect size = 0.70) and knee flexion moment (mean difference = 1.32% body weight * height, p = 0.003, effect size = 0.76), during weight acceptance. These results indicate that high muscle co-contraction does not always result in high knee joint loading, which is thought to be associated with knee osteoarthritis. Long-term follow-up is required to evaluate how gait alterations progress in non-osteoarthritic versus osteoarthritic subjects. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

TI  - Clinical outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament injury: Panther Symposium ACL Injury Clinical Outcomes Consensus Group
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose A stringent outcome assessment is a key aspect for establishing evidence-based clinical guidelines for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury treatment. The aim of this consensus statement was to establish what data should be reported when conducting an ACL outcome study, what specific outcome measurements should be used and at what follow-up time those outcomes should be assessed. Methods To establish a standardised assessment of clinical outcome after ACL treatment, a consensus meeting including a multidisciplinary group of ACL experts was held at the ACL Consensus Meeting Panther Symposium, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, in June 2019. The group reached consensus on nine statements by using a modified Delphi method. Results In general, outcomes after ACL treatment can be divided into four robust categories—early adverse events, patient-reported outcomes, ACL graft failure/recurrent ligament disruption, and clinical measures of knee function and structure. A comprehensive assessment following ACL treatment should aim to provide a complete overview of the treatment result, optimally including the various aspects of outcome categories. For most research questions, a minimum follow-up of 2 years with an optimal follow-up rate of 80% is necessary to achieve a comprehensive assessment. This should include clinical examination, any sustained re-injuries, validated knee-specific patient-reported outcomes and Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaires. In the mid-term to long-term follow-up, the presence of osteoarthritis should be evaluated. Conclusion This consensus paper provides practical guidelines for how the aforementioned entities of outcomes should be reported and suggests the preferred tools for a reliable and valid assessment of outcome after ACL treatment.

TI  - ACL reconstruction: a meta-analysis of functional scores.
PY  - 2007
AB  - From individual randomized studies, it is unclear whether patellar tendon grafts or hamstring tendon grafts yield the best functional results after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to provide quantitative data to compare patellar with hamstring grafts after ACL reconstruction with regard to knee function. We searched computerized databases for randomized controlled trials reporting one of the following outcomes related to function: final overall International Knee Documentation Committee score and return to preinjury level of activity. Studies were abstracted independently by two reviewers. Random effect models were used to pool the data. Fourteen trials (1263 patients) met the inclusion criteria. We found no difference in final overall International Knee Documentation Committee score or in the number of patients returning to full activity after patellar and hamstring graft reconstruction. Relative risk was 0.90 for final overall International Knee Documentation Committee Class A and 0.94 for return to preinjury level of activity in favor of patellar grafts. Quantitative interaction tests on the effect of treatment based on study quality, randomization status, number of strands used, and length of followup were non significant. At last followup, only 41% and 33% of patients, respectively, had patellar and hamstring grafts reconstructed reported as normal based on the final overall International Knee Documentation Committee score.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Improves Activity-Induced Pain in Comparison With Pain at Rest in Middle-Aged Patients With Significant Cartilage Degeneration
PY  - 2010
AB  - Background: Recent reports revealed that outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in middle- or old-age patients are comparable with those of young patients. However, in case of concomitant arthrosis in the affected knee, there has been a paucity of literature regarding the outcomes of ACL reconstruction. We studied the level of improvement in pain originating from significant cartilage degeneration in middle-aged ACL-deficient patients after ACL reconstruction. We divided the pain into pain at rest and activity-induced pain.Hypothesis: The activity-induced pain would be more improved by ACL reconstruction than the pain at rest.Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Methods: We studied 36 patients who had undergone arthroscopic isolated ACL reconstruction for functional instability with significant cartilage degeneration grade III or IV without mensical injury. All patients had activity-induced pain; 20 of these patients also had pain at rest. To assess the pain level, the visu...

TI  - Comparison of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction methods between reverse "Y" plasty reconstruction and traditional single-bundle technique-A cadaveric study.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Summary Background In 2009, a reverse “Y” plasty anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction technique was proposed, with double-tibial tunnel and single-femoral tunnel, and the result obtained proved that the reverse “Y” plasty technique was satisfactory. This cadaveric study was designed to compare the reverse “Y” plasty reconstruction method with the conventional single-bundle technique for the first time. Methods In this study, 30 cadaveric knees were used and were randomly divided into five groups with six knees each. Six cadaveric knees with intact ACL were treated as the control group, and another six knees with ruptured ACL were treated as the rupture group. In group A, the single-bundle technique was used. In groups B and C, reverse “Y” plasty technique was used, and the grafts were fixed with absorbable biointerference screws in tibiae and absorbable biointerference screws (Group B) or Endobutton (Group C) in femora. Five groups were tested with an MTS material testing machine (MTS-858) by the use of a cyclic loading of 134 N at 15°, 30°, 60° and 90° of knee flexion and a combined 7-Nm valgus torque and 5-Nm internal tibial rotation torque at 15°, 30°, 45° and 60° of knee flexion. Results Both single-bundle and reverse “Y” plasty groups demonstrated similar anterior–posterior stability compared with the control group, whereas the single-bundle group showed inferior rotational stability tested at 30° and 45° of knee flexion than the reverse “Y” plasty group and control group. These two different fixation methods at the femoral site (Group B and C) showed no difference in anterior–posterior and rotational stability. Conclusions The new reverse “Y” plasty ACL reconstruction method may restore normal knee stability, especially rotational stability, better than single-bundle reconstruction. The translational potential of this article This study provides strong support for the new reverse “Y” plasty ACL reconstruction technique and is expected to propose a new surgical approach with good biomechanical features.

TI  - Concomitant partial meniscectomy worsens outcome after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2002
AB  - In this multi-center study involving 412 patients, we assessed the influence of concomitant partial meniscal resection on the medium-term clinical results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. We performed a resection of minimum one-third of the medial or lateral menisci in 137 patients (group M) and found intact menisci in 275 patients (group NM). Those who had undergone previous meniscal surgery, subsequent meniscal surgery or a re-rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament graft during the follow-up were not included. After a median of 3 (2-6) years, the patients were reexamined by independent observers. Group M patients had more pain, swelling and laxity than those in group NM; they also had a worse classification according to the IKDC system, lower Lysholm scores and a greater proportion of patients with loss of motion.

TI  - Anatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a calcium phosphate-hybridized tendon graft: a randomized controlled trial with 2 years of follow-up.
PY  - 2018
AB  - To improve tendon-to-bone healing in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, a novel technique via calcium phosphate (CaP)-hybridized tendon graft using an alternate soaking process was developed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical results of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction using the CaP-hybridized tendon graft with up to 2 years follow-up, and compare the outcome with conventional ACL reconstruction and preoperative data. Ninety patients who required anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction were randomized to undergo either the CaP-hybridized tendon graft method (CaP group, n = 45) or the conventional method (conventional group, n = 45). At 1 and 2 years postoperatively, all patients were evaluated using KT-1000 arthrometry, pivot-shift test, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) grade, Lysholm scale, and Tegner scale; at the same timepoints, bone tunnel enlargement was evaluated using computed tomography, and the tendon graft intensity was evaluated on magnetic resonance imaging. Tendon graft appearance was evaluated arthroscopically once after a period of up to 2 years postoperatively. Cases of re-rupture and adverse events were recorded in both groups. In both groups, the KT-1000 arthrometry, pivot-shift test, IKDC grade, and Lysholm scale results at 1 and 2 years postoperatively were superior to preoperative data; these results did not significantly differ between groups at either timepoint. The rate of increase of the cross-sectional area of the femoral bone tunnel in the CaP group was smaller than that in the conventional group at 1 year postoperatively. The other results did not significantly differ between the two groups at any timepoint. There were two cases of re-rupture in the CaP group, and six cases of re-rupture in the conventional group. There were no adverse events during follow-up in either group. Anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction using a CaP-hybridized tendon graft was safe, and resulted in improved clinical outcomes at 2 years postoperatively compared with preoperative data; the outcomes were comparable with the conventional method. A longer follow-up is needed to clarify the clinical effects of the CaP-hybridized tendon graft in anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction. UMIN, UMIN000019788

TI  - Combined Anterior Cruciate Ligament and Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction Shows Superior Graft Remodeling, Maturation, and Stability Compared With Isolated Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare graft remodeling, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and clinical outcomes between patients who underwent isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) versus combined anterior cruciate ligament and anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ACLR + ALLR).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A retrospective review was conducted on patients who underwent primary ACLR with quadruple hamstring grafts between January 2019 and March 2022, with a minimum follow-up period of 2 years. Patients were categorized into 2 groups on the basis of the addition of ALLR with tibialis anterior allografts: an isolated ACLR group and an ACLR + ALLR group. Graft ligamentization was assessed using signal-to-noise quotient (SNQ) values obtained from postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scans, with lower SNQ values indicating superior graft remodeling. Clinical outcomes were evaluated through knee stability tests (pivot-shift test, side-to-side laxity), functional outcomes, and graft retear rates. The minimal clinically important difference for the clinical scores was calculated using the distribution-based method of a half standard deviation of the delta (difference between postoperative and baseline values). Regression analyses identified potential predictive factors for inferior ACL graft remodeling.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 122 patients in the isolated ACLR group and 54 in the ACLR + ALLR group were evaluated. The mean follow-up periods were similar between the groups (34.1 ± 7.4 months vs 36.4 ± 9.0 months; P = .755). The mean SNQ values were significantly lower in the ACLR + ALLR group compared with the isolated ACLR group (2.8 ± 1.6 vs 4.7 ± 3.5 mm, respectively; P = .001). Inferior ACL graft maturity was associated with an increased posterior tibial slope (P = .016), narrow notch width (P =.018), and concomitant medial meniscal lesion (P = .017). At the final evaluation, the ACLR + ALLR group demonstrated better rotational stability as indicated by the residual pivot-shift test (P = .005). No statistically significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in side-to-side laxity, functional outcomes, or graft retear rates. There were no differences in the percentage of patients achieving minimal clinically important difference for the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score between the groups (P = .536).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Combined ACLR and ALLR resulted in superior graft remodeling, demonstrated by a mean SNQ value that was 1.9 lower than in isolated ACLR, along with improved rotational stability.</AbstractText>

TI  - Outcome of surgery for recurrent patellar dislocation based on the distance of the tibial tuberosity to the trochlear groove
PY  - 2010
AB  - We evaluated the outcome in a series of patients with recurrent patellar dislocation who had either medial transfer of the tibial tuberosity and lateral release or an isolated lateral release as the primary treatment. The decision to use one or other procedure was based on a pre-operative distance between the tibial tuberosity to the trochlear groove (TTTG) of less than 10 mm to include the tibial tuberosity transfer in addition to the lateral release. Between April 2002 and December 2006, 49 patients (63 knees) underwent one of these procedures. A total of 35 patients (46 knees) was evaluated at a mean of 38 months (13 to 71) post-operatively. Medial transfer of the tibial tuberosity was performed in 33 knees and isolated lateral release in the remaining 13. Evaluation included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), the Kujala and the Short-form 36 scores. From the tibial tuberosity group 23 knees also underwent radiological examination at follow-up. There were further episodes of patellar dislocation in six of the 46 knees available for review. Further dislocation was noted in five of 33 knees (15.2%) in the tibial tuberosity transfer group and in one of 13 knees (7.7%) in the lateral release group. The mean subjective IKDC score was 80.4 (sd 11.6), the mean Kujala score 88 (sd 8.2) and the mean objective IKDC score was 79% normal and 21% nearly normal. The mean post-operative TTTG distance in the tibial tuberosity transfer group was 8.9 mm (3.2 to 15.7) compared with the mean pre-operative value of 16.8 mm (12.2 to 24.4).

TI  - Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in osteoarthritis (OA) knee: Correct dose critical for long term clinical efficacy.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Despite encouraging results reported with regards to Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) application in osteoarthritis (OA) knee, still critical issues like conclusive structural evidence of its efficacy, standard dose and good manual method of preparation to obtain high yield remains unanswered. Present study is an attempt to optimise the dose and concentration of therapeutic PRP and its correlation with structural, physiologic efficacy with a new manual method of PRP preparation. A total of one hundred and fifty patients were randomized to receive either PRP (10 billion platelets) or hyaluronic acid (HA; 4 ml; 75 patients in each group) and followed up till 1 year. An addition of filtration step with 1 µm filter in manual PRP processing improved platelet recovery upto 90%. Significant improvements in WOMAC (51.94 ± 7.35 vs. 57.33 ± 8.92; P < 0.001), IKDC scores (62.8 ± 6.24 vs 52.7 ± 6.39; P < 0.001), 6-min pain free walking distance (+ 120 vs. + 4; P < 0.001) persisted in PRP compared to HA group at 1 year. Significant decline IL-6 and TNF-α levels observed in PRP group (P < 0.05) compared to HA at 1 month. Study demonstrated that an absolute count of 10 billion platelets is crucial in a PRP formulation to have long sustained chondroprotective effect upto one year in moderate knee OA.

TI  - Pivot-shift test: analysis and quantification of knee laxity parameters using a navigation system
PY  - 2009
AB  - Lachman, drawer, and pivot-shift (PS) tests are important in the assessment of ACL reconstruction. The goal of this work was to analyze the reliability of the PS test using a navigation system, identifying a set of new quantitative parameters and evaluating their clinical relevance. Eighteen patients that underwent anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction were included. The new dynamic parameters were: anteroposterior translation of the medial and lateral compartments and the joint center and internal/external and varus/valgus rotations of the joint. For each parameter we measured the peaks and the areas obtained during the test. Intratester repeatability, comparisons of pre- and postoperative laxities, and correlations between the PS peaks and the corresponding peaks obtained with standard static tests were evaluated. Areas, peaks, and static laxity outcomes were compared, grouping patients according to the preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score. The PS test was reliable in identifying the surgical reconstruction. Correlation analysis showed good coefficients both for pre- and postoperative values. Patients with IKDC grade "D" had larger areas during the PS compared to patients with grade "C". Our analysis is helpful for characterizing patient-specific laxity and surgical performance, thus highlighting the clinical relevance of the PS test.

TI  - Dynamic postural control in women athletes with and without nonspecific low back pain with high and low pain-related anxiety- A case-control study.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Low back pain is common among athletes and it has been shown that postural control is altered in the general population with nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP). Psychological factors may also predispose individuals to risk of altered postural control. Dynamic postural control is essential to the performance of athletes. This study aimed to compare the dynamic postural control between women athletes with and without NSLBP with high and low pain-related anxiety.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Forty-five female athletes (15 NSLBP with high pain-related anxiety, 15 NSLBP with low pain-related anxiety, and 15 healthy (control)) were included. Pain-related anxiety was assessed using the Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale-20 (PASS-20). Based on the cut-off score of 30 for the total score of PASS-20, NSLBP patients were classified into two groups of low and high pain-related anxiety. Participants performed double-leg vertical drop jump (DVJ) and single-leg vertical jump (SVJ) tests on a Kistler force plate (type 9260AA6, Kistler Instruments Inc, Switzerland). The total root mean square (RMS) of the center of pressure (COP), COP displacement in the anteroposterior (AP), and mediolateral (ML) directions, COP mean velocity, and time to stabilization (TTS) in vertical, AP, and total directions were extracted from COP and ground reaction force data using MATLAB software. One-way Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Welch's ANOVA were employed to compare the groups. In case of significant findings, post hoc tests were performed.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The results showed that during DJV, athletes with high pain-related anxiety had significantly greater TTS in all total, AP, and ML directions than other groups (P &lt; 0.05). Also, the control group showed greater total RMS distance during DJV than either NSLBP group. However, no significant differences in TTS and COP parameters were found between the groups during SVJ (P &gt; 0.05).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The findings suggest that pain-related anxiety may contribute to athletes' postural control strategies. Therefore, it is important to consider the level of pain-related anxiety during planning postural control exercises for women athletes with NSLBP.</AbstractText>

TI  - Does anterior laxity of the uninjured knee influence clinical outcomes of ACL reconstruction
PY  - 2014
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between the postoperative outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and the anterior laxity of the uninjured knee.
We retrospectively reviewed 163 patients who had undergone unilateral ACL reconstruction from January 2002 to August 2009. Patients were divided into three groups according to the anterior laxity of the contralateral, normal knee in 30° of knee flexion as measured with a KT2000 arthrometer exerting a force of 134 N: 7.5 mm for Group 3. Anterior laxity of the uninjured knee was assessed preoperatively, and anterior laxity of the reconstructed knee was assessed at twenty-four months postoperatively. Anterior stability of the knee was also assessed with use of the Lachman and pivot-shift tests. Functional outcomes were assessed with the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score.
The three groups differed significantly with respect to the postoperative side-to-side difference in anterior laxity (p = 0.015), Lysholm score (p < 0.001), and IKDC subjective score (p < 0.001). The mean side-to-side difference in anterior laxity of the reconstructed knee was 2.1 ± 1.3 mm in Group 1, 2.2 ± 1.3 mm in Group 2, and 2.9 ± 1.4 mm in Group 3. The postoperative Lysholm score was 91.8 ± 4.5 in Group 1, 90.3 ± 5.5 in Group 2, and 85.4 ± 6.6 in Group 3. The postoperative IKDC subjective score was 89.3 ± 6.4 in Group 1, 87.9 ± 6.0 in Group 2, and 82.6 ± 8.2 in Group 3. Post hoc testing showed that Group 3 had significantly greater anterior laxity (p ≤ 0.039) and lower functional scores (p ≤ 0.001) compared with Groups 1 and 2.
Greater anterior laxity of the uninjured knee was associated with poorer stability and functional outcomes after ACL reconstruction. Excessive anterior laxity of the uninjured knee thus appears to represent a risk factor for inferior outcomes.

TI  - Reconstructive versus non-reconstructive treatment of anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency. A retrospective matched-pair long-term follow-up
PY  - 2010
AB  - In this retrospective case series 80 patients divided in 40 matched pair groups with an arthroscopically proven ACL insufficiency were followed up for 15 years. One half was reconstructed using an autologous BTB patella graft, the other half was treated by a conservative physiotherapeutic based rehabilitation program. At follow-up the clinical scores (Lysholm, IKDC) showed no significant differences between subjects who had undergone ACL reconstruction and those who had not. Furthermore there was no detectable difference in the incidence of osteoarthritis between the cohorts. Patients having a negative pivot shift test showed significantly less signs of radiographic osteoarthritis and better functional assessment scores whether reconstructed or not. Based on these results and a review of the literature there is no clear evidence that ACL reconstruction reduces the rate of OA development or improves the long-term symptomatic outcome. Probably review of reconstruction by an anatomical approach will be more successful than operative techniques decades ago.

TI  - Factors influencing the outcome after surgical reconstruction of OTA type B and C tibial plateau fractures: how crucial is the restoration of articular congruity?
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Only few and inconsistent data about the impact of articular congruity and tolerable residual intraarticular steps and gaps of the joint surface after tibial plateau fractures exist. Therefore, aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between OTA type B and C tibial plateau fracture outcomes and postoperative articular congruity using computed tomography (CT) data.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Fifty-five patients with a mean age of 45.5 ± 12.5 years and treated for 27 type B and 28 C tibial plateau fractures with pre- and postsurgical CT data were included. Primary outcome measure was the correlation of postoperative intraarticular step and gap sizes, articular comminution area, the postoperative medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), and the Lysholm and IKDC score. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine threshold values for step and gap heights according to the following outcome scores: IKDC &gt; 70; Lysholm &gt; 80. Secondary outcome measures were the correlation of fracture severity, the number of complications and surgical revisions and the outcome scores, as well as the Tegner activity score before injury and at final follow-up.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">After a mean follow-up of 42.4 ± 18.9 months, the mean Lysholm score was 80.7 ± 13.3, and the mean IKDC score was 62.7 ± 17.6. The median Tegner activity score was 5 before the injury and 4 at final follow-up (p &lt; 0.05). The intraarticular step height, gap size, comminution area and MPTA deviation were significantly negatively correlated with the IKDC and Lysholm scores. The cutoff values for step height were 2.6 and 2.9 mm. The gap size threshold was 6.6 mm. In total, an average of 0.5 ± 0.8 (range 0-3) complications occurred, and on average, 0.5 ± 1.1 (range 0-7) surgical revisions had to be performed. The number of complications and surgical revisions also had negative impacts on the outcome. Neither fracture severity nor BMI or patient's age was significantly correlated with the IKDC or Lysholm score.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Tibial plateau fractures are severe injuries, which lead to a subsequent reduced level of patient activity. Precise reconstruction of the articular surface with regard to intraarticular step and gap size, residual comminution area and joint angle is decisive for the final outcome. Complications and surgical revisions also worsen it.</AbstractText>

TI  - Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a hamstring graft with interference screw fixation.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Background and aims This study assessed the clinical and radiographic results 3 to 8 years after an arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using a hamstring graft with interference screw fixation on femoral and tibial sites. Material and methods Seventy-six of 100 patients, who underwent an arthroscopic ACL reconstruction, could be re-examined with a mean follow-up of 5 years. Results The mean Tegner activity score was 4 (scale: 0 to 10) before surgery, and 5 at the follow-up. Fifty-four patients (78%) achieved a satisfactory result in the IKDC rating. The mean Lysholm score was 85 (scale: 0 to 100), the score being better in patients without meniscal resection than those with (P = 0.04). The mean side-to-side difference in anterior-posterior knee laxity was 1.8 mm, and 62 patients (90%) had good stability. Sixty-four patients (93%) had normal range of motion of the knee. Twelve patients (46%) with meniscal resection had osteoarthritic changes, compared with only 8 of those (20%) without meniscal resection (P = 0.03). Conclusions This medium-term follow-up study showed that good stability and function and normal range of motion of the knee can be achieved in majority of the patients who have undergone an ACL reconstruction with a hamstring graft and interference screw fixation.

TI  - The Long-Term Outcome After Early and Late Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Purpose To compare long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients undergoing either early (group A) or late (group B) surgery after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Methods ACL reconstruction using hamstring tendon autografts was performed in 30 patients in group A (median age, 23 years; range, 17-49 years) and 31 patients in group B (median age, 27 years; range, 17-38 years). The patients in group A were operated on within 5 months (median, 3 months; range, 2-5 months) of injury, whereas those in group B were operated on more than 24 months (median, 30 months; range, 24-48 months) after injury. The follow-up period was 10 years (median, 117 months [range, 77-222 months] in group A and 129 months [range, 77-206 months] in group B; P  = .44). Multiple objective clinical evaluation tests and patient-reported outcome measures were obtained preoperatively and at follow-up. At follow-up, radiographic assessments of knee osteoarthritis (OA) bilaterally were performed. Results The frequency of meniscectomy at the index operation was significantly lower in group A (20%) than in group B (52%) ( P  = .01). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of Tegner and Lysholm scores and laxity tests both preoperatively and at follow-up. Both groups improved over time in terms of Tegner and Lysholm scores ( P P  = .037) according to the Ahlback classification system. The index knee showed significantly more OA than the contralateral knee in both groups ( P Conclusions Patients who underwent early ACL reconstruction required significantly fewer meniscectomies at the index operation than patients who underwent late reconstruction and showed significantly less OA on the medial side of the knee 10 years after reconstruction. However, no significant differences were found between the groups in terms of clinical assessments. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative study.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have found significant predictors for functional outcome after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction; however, studies examining predictors for functional outcome in nonoperatively treated individuals are lacking.Hypothesis: Single-legged hop tests predict self-reported knee function (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] 2000) in nonoperatively treated ACL-injured individuals 1 year after baseline testing.Study Design: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2.Methods: Ninety-one nonoperatively treated patients with an ACL injury were tested using 4 single-legged hop tests on average 74 ± 30 days after injury in a prospective cohort study. Eighty-one patients (89%) completed the IKDC 2000 1 year later. Patients with an IKDC 2000 score equal to or higher than the age- and gender-specific 15th percentile score from previously published data on an uninjured population were classified as having self-reported function within normal ranges. Logistic regre...

TI  - Clinical Outcomes of Posterolateral Complex Reconstruction Performed with a Single Femoral Tunnel.
PY  - 2019
AB  - The objective of this study is to report the functional outcomes, complications, and reconstruction failure rate of patients undergoing posterolateral complex reconstruction with a single femoral tunnel technique. Patients with posterolateral complex injuries associated with injury of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), or both undergoing surgical treatment with the single femoral tunnel technique were included in the study. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm's scales were evaluated, in addition to age, gender, time between trauma and surgery, trauma type, range of motion (ROM) restrictions, peroneal nerve injury, and reconstruction failure. Sixty-six patients were included. Eighteen underwent ACL and posterolateral complex (PLC) reconstruction (group 1), 24 underwent ACL, PCL, and PLC reconstruction (group 2), and 24 underwent PCL and PLC reconstruction (group 3). The mean follow-up was 63 months. The subjective IKDC was 83.7 ± 14.6 for group 1, 74.3 ± 12.6 for group 2, and 66.3 ± 16.0 for group 3 (p < 0.001). The Lysholm's score was 87.1 ± 12.8 for group 1, 79.5 ± 15.0 for group 2, and 77.7 ± 15.2 for group 3 (p = 0.042). There were six reconstruction failures among the patients (9.1%) with no differences among the groups (p = 0.368). Female gender and reconstruction failure were associated with worse outcomes. Patients undergoing reconstruction of PLC structures with the single femoral tunnel technique achieved good functional outcomes and a failure rate similar to literature. Patients undergoing only combined ACL reconstruction showed better outcomes than patients undergoing combined PCL reconstruction. Female gender was associated with a worse functional outcome irrespective of the injury type.

TI  - Effects of Remnant Tissue Preservation on Clinical and Arthroscopic Results After Anatomic Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background:Clinical utility of remnant tissue preservation after single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has not been established. In addition, no studies have evaluated the clinical utility of remnant preservation after anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction.Hypothesis:The study hypotheses were as follows: (1) Subjective and functional clinical results may be comparable between anatomic double-bundle reconstructions that preserve the remnant tissue and those that resect the remnant tissue, (2) postoperative knee stability and the second-look arthroscopic evaluation may be significantly more favorable with the remnant-preserving reconstruction, and (3) the degree of the initial graft coverage may significantly affect postoperative knee stability.Study Design:Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.Methods:A total of 179 patients underwent anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction. Based on the Crain classification of ACL remnant tissue, 81 patients underwent the remnant-preserving proc...

TI  - Outcome of posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the single- versus double bundle technique: a meta-analysis.
PY  - 2015
AB  - ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that double bundle posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction yields better improvement in stability and functional recovery of the knee than the single bundle technique.MethodsPubMed®, Embase®, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang and CBM disc databases were searched for comparative trials of PCL reconstruction using the single- versus double bundle technique. Data were extracted and meta-analysis was performed for stability improvement and functional recovery.ResultsThe meta-analysis included 435 patients in three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and eight non-RCTs. Double bundle reconstruction provided significantly better 90° posterior stability than the single bundle technique (weighted mean difference 0.81, 95% confidence interval, [CI] 0.2, 1.42). Double bundle reconstruction resulted in a significantly higher likelihood of International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) examination grade A than the single bundle technique (odds ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.24, 0.7...

TI  - Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the double press-fit technique: An alternative to interference screw fixation
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract Purpose: Patellar tendon autograft fixation in arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is commonly accomplished using interference screws. However, improper insertion of the screws may reduce primary stability, injure the posterior femoral cortex, or displace hardware into the joint. Even if placed properly, metallic screws interfere with postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. In case of revision surgery, removing screws may be difficult and leaves bone defects. Type of Study: Retrospective study. Methods: An arthroscopic technique was developed that achieves patellar tendon autograft fixation by press-fit without any supplemental internal fixation. Forty patients were examined clinically and by KT-1000 arthrometer 28.7 months (range, 22 to 40 months) postoperatively. Results: The mean difference in side-to-side laxity was 1.3 mm (SD 2.2) and the results according to the IKDC score were as follows: 7 A, 28 B, 5 C, and 0 D. Conclusions: The double press-fit technique we present avoids all complications related to the use of interference screws and creates an ideal environment for osseous integration of the bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft. Concurrently, it achieves a stable fixation of the autograft and allows early functional rehabilitation. However, fixation strength depends on bone quality and the arthroscopic procedure is demanding.

TI  - Instrumental Dynamic Laxity Evaluation: Non-invasive Inertial Sensors
PY  - 2017
AB  - Pivot shift (PS) test analyzes the knee joint under a dynamic situation and tests both anterior-posterior and rotational laxity. The significance and role of any grading method lies in its ability to support the decision-making process during diagnosis, surgical treatment, and recovery phase after surgery. Currently, the ability to perform a correct diagnosis of the injury severity as well as quantification of recovery after surgical treatment is mainly based on the surgeon’s sensibility in interpreting the clinical examination. In fact, the main problem in the use of PS test is its complexity which makes itself a surgeon-subjective clinical examination.

TI  - Associated lateral/medial knee instability and its relevant factors in anterior cruciate ligament-injured knees
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Background Associations of lateral/medial knee instability with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury have not been thoroughly investigated. The purposes of this study were to investigate whether lateral/medial knee instability is associated with ACL injury, and to clarify relevant factors for lateral/medial knee instability in ACL-injured knees. Methods One hundred and nineteen patients with unilateral ACL-injured knees were included. Lateral/medial knee instability was assessed with varus/valgus stress X-ray examination for both injured and uninjured knees by measuring varus/valgus angle, lateral/medial joint opening, and lateral/medial joint opening index. Manual knee instability tests for ACL were evaluated to investigate associations between lateral/medial knee instability and anterior and/or rotational instabilities. Patients' backgrounds were evaluated to identify relevant factors for lateral/medial knee instability. Damage on the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) on MRI was also evaluated. Results All parameters regarding lateral knee instability in injured knees were significantly greater than in uninjured knees. There were significant correlations between lateral knee instability and the Lachman test as well as the pivot shift test. Patients with LCL damage had significantly greater lateral joint opening than those without LCL damage on MRI. Sensitivity of LCL damage on MRI to lateral joint opening was 100%, while its specificity was 36%. No other relevant factors were identified. In medial knee instability, there were also correlations between medial knee instability and the Lachman test/pivot shift test. However, the correlations were weak and other parameters were not significant. Conclusions Lateral knee instability was greater in ACL-deficient knees than in uninjured knees. Lateral knee instability was associated with ACL-related instabilities as well as LCL damage on MRI, whereas MRI had low specificity to lateral knee instability. On the other hand, the association of medial knee instability on ACL-related instability was less than that of lateral knee instability. Levels of evidence Level IV, case series with no comparison group.

TI  - Retraction for article: The effect of graft choice on functional outcome in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2009
AB  - A prospective, randomised, 5-year follow-up study was designed to compare the functional results between patellar tendon and hamstring tendon autografts after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Primary reconstruction was performed in 32 patients using the central third of the patellar ligament and in 32 patients using double-looped semitendinosus and gracilis tendons. All reconstructions were performed by a single surgeon, with identical surgical technique and rehabilitation protocol. Of the total 64 patients in the study, 54 (85%) were available for the 5-year follow-up. No statistically significant differences were seen with respect to Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) classification, clinical and KT-2000 arthrometer laxity testing, single-legged hop test and anterior knee pain. Graft rupture occurred in two patients (8%) in the patellar tendon group and in two patients (7%) in the hamstring tendon group; 23 patients (88%) in the patellar tendon group and 23 patients (82%) in the hamstring tendon group returned to their pre-injury activity level. Good subjective outcome and stability can be obtained by using either graft; no statistically significant differences were found in functional outcome between the grafts.

TI  - Asymmetries in explosive strength following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract Background Despite its apparent functional importance, there is a general lack of data regarding the time-related changes in explosive strength and the corresponding side-to-side asymmetries in individuals recovering from an ACL reconstruction (ACLR). The present study was designed to assess changes in the maximum and explosive strength of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles in athletes recovering from an ACLR. Methods Twenty male athletes with an ACL injury completed a standard isometric testing protocol pre-ACLR, four and sixmonths post-ACLR. In addition to the maximum strength (F max ), the explosive strength of quadriceps and hamstrings was assessed through four variables derived from the slope of the force–time curves over various time intervals (RFD max , RFD 50 , RFD 150 and RFD 250 ). Side-to-side asymmetries were calculated relative to post-ACLR measures of the uninvolved leg ("standard" asymmetries), and relative to pre-ACLR value of the uninvolved leg ("real" asymmetries). Results Pre-ACLR asymmetries in quadriceps RFD (average 26%) were already larger than in F max (14%) (p max were 10%, 25% and 15% for pre-ACLR and two post-ACLR sessions, respectively (all p>0.05). Conclusions In addition to the maximum strength, the indices of explosive strength should also be included in monitoring recovery of muscle function following an ACLR. Furthermore, pre-injury/reconstruction values should be used for the post-ACLR side-to-side comparisons, providing a more valid criterion regarding the muscle recovery and readiness for a return to sports.

A cohort of 140 patients underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) and were randomized to ipsilateral or contralateral ST graft harvest. Isokinetic and isometric muscle strength testing using a dynamometer were collected for the operated and non-operated leg. Patients were assessed pre-surgery and at 6, 12 and 24 months after reconstruction. ST graft harvest reduced isokinetic flexion muscle strength for 6 months. At 12 months follow up there was no significant difference between the two groups and they were all stronger than pre-injury. No other significant differences were found in any primary or secondary outcome measurements. Solitary ST graft harvest does not appear to result in a permanent reduced isometric or isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength on the side where the graft is harvested. A reduction in hamstring muscle strength of less than 10% can be seen at short-term follow-up with full recovery by 12 months. Most patients report little or no donor site pain. Given these findings, ST autograft is an alternative graft choice that could be used for various reconstructions in terms of donor site morbidity. Level II.

TI  - Meniscus Status at Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Associated with Radiographic Signs of Osteoarthritis at 5- to 10-Year Follow-Up –A Systematic Review
PY  - 2009
AB  - The development of premature osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a significant cause of morbidity in young, active individuals. Meniscal injuries are frequently noted at the time of reconstruction, and the critical role of an intact meniscus in the prevention of osteoarthritis has been well documented. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the effects of meniscal status at ACL reconstruction on the subsequent development of osteoarthritis. A systematic review of the literature identified 11 studies with > or = 2 years of follow-up that compared patients' radiographic outcomes based on meniscus status at the time of ACL reconstruction. Patients undergoing partial meniscectomy at the time of ACL reconstruction were significantly more likely to develop radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis than those with normal menisci. Meniscal repair resulted in inconsistent findings. Virtually all patients who underwent complete meniscectomy at the time of ACL reconstruction had radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis at follow-up.

TI  - Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in patients over 50 years
PY  - 2008
AB  - The records of patients aged 50 years or over who underwent primary reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament between 1990 and 2002 were reviewed. There were 35 knees in 34 patients that met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was 57 years (50 to 66) and the mean clinical follow-up was for 72 months (25 to 173). A total of 23 knees were reconstructed with patellar tendon allograft, and 12 with patellar tendon autograft. The mean pre-operative knee extension was 1° (−5° to 10°) and flexion was 129° (125° to 150°) and at follow-up these values were 0° (−5° to 5°) and 135° (120° to 150°), respectively. Pre-operatively there were 31 knees (89%) with a Lachman grade 2+ or 3+. Post-operatively, 33 knees (94%) were Lachman grade 0 or 1+. The mean pre- and post-operative International Knee Documentation Committee scores were 39 (23 to 72) and 90 (33 to 100) respectively. The mean pre- and post-operative Lysholm scores were 50 (18 to 68) and 92 (28 to 100) respectively and the mean University of California Los Angeles activity scores were 8.5 before injury (4 to 10), 4.3 (3 to 6) after injury and 8.3 (4 to 10) post-operatively. There were three graft failures (8.6%) requiring revision. We conclude that reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in carefully-selected patients aged 50 years or over can achieve similar results to those in younger patients, with no increased risk of complications.

TI  - Drilling the femoral tunnel during ACL reconstruction: transtibial versus anteromedial portal techniques
PY  - 2012
AB  - Incorrect bone tunnel position, particularly on the femoral side, is a frequent cause of failed anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Several studies have reported that drilling the femoral tunnel through the anteromedial portal allows a more anatomical placement on the lateral femoral condyle and higher knee stability than does transtibial reconstruction.In the current study, the femoral tunnel was drilled with transtibial (n=6) and anteromedial (n=6) portal techniques in 12 cadaveric knees. With appropriate landmarks inserted into bone tunnels, the direction and length of the tunnels were determined on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. Knee stability was evaluated with a KT1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric Corporation, San Diego, California) and pivot shift test, comparing the pre- and postoperative values of both techniques. Finally, all knees were dissected to enhance vision of the insertion of the reconstructed ligament. The anteromedial portal technique led to better placement of the femoral tunnel in the coronal and sagittal planes, with higher knee stability according to the pivot shift test but not the KT1000 arthrometer. Anatomical and clinical results reported in the literature on transtibial and anteromedial portal techniques are controversial, but most of studies report better results with the anteromedial portal technique, especially regarding rotational stability. The current cadaveric study showed that the anteromedial portal technique provided better tunnel placement on the lateral femoral condyle in the coronal and sagittal planes, with an improvement in the rotational stability of the knee.

TI  - Preoperative Meniscal Extrusion Predicts Unsatisfactory Clinical Outcomes and Progression of Osteoarthritis after Isolated Partial Medial Meniscectomy: A 5-Year Follow-Up Study.
PY  - 2020
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the association between preoperative meniscal extrusion of patients undergoing partial medial meniscectomy with clinical outcomes and progression of osteoarthritis and to determine the extent of meniscal extrusion associated with unsatisfactory clinical outcomes and progression of osteoarthritis. Ninety-five patients who underwent partial medial meniscectomy with a minimum follow-up of 5 years were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative meniscal extrusion was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively with Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores for clinical outcomes and with IKDC radiographic scale for osteoarthritis. An ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) was used to analyze the variations in meniscal extrusion and the clinical and radiological outcomes. A regression analysis was performed to identify factors that affect preoperative medial meniscus extrusion and that influence results after partial meniscectomy. An optimal cutoff value for meniscal extrusion associated with unsatisfactory clinical outcomes and progression of osteoarthritis was established. Significance was set at p

TI  - Delayed Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Increases the Risk of Abnormal Prereconstruction Laxity, Cartilage, and Medial Meniscus Injuries.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose To determine the association between a delay in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and cartilage injuries, meniscus injuries, meniscus repair, and abnormal prereconstruction laxity. Methods Patients who underwent primary ACLR at our institution from January 2005 to March 2017, with no associated ligament injuries, were identified. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate whether delay in ACLR, age, sex, and BMI were risk factors for cartilage and meniscus injuries, meniscus repair, and abnormal (side-to-side difference >5 mm) prereconstruction laxity. Results A total of 3976 patients (mean age 28.6 ± 10.6 years, range 10-61 years) were included. The risk of cartilage injury increased with a delay in ACLR (12-24 months: odds ratio [OR] 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.29; P = .005; and > 24 months: OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.11-1.30; P 24 months: OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.13-1.30; P 3 months and age ≥30 years (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.66-0.85; P  24 months: OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.52-0.72; P 6 months and MM injury (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.16-1.97; P = .002), whereas it decreased with a BMI of ≥25 (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.52-0.89; P = .006). Conclusions A delay in ACLR of >12 months increased the risk of cartilage and MM injuries, whereas a delay of >6 months increased the risk of abnormal prereconstruction laxity and reduced the likelihood of MM repair. To reduce meniscus loss and the risk of jeopardizing knee laxity, ACLR should be performed within 6 months after the injury. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective therapeutic comparative study.

TI  - Factors influencing postoperative outcomes in patients with symptomatic discoid lateral meniscus
PY  - 2020
AB  - Due to its abnormal morphology and ultrastructure, discoid lateral meniscus (DLM) is prone to tear and degeneration, leading to clinical symptoms. Arthroscopy is the main treatment for symptomatic DLM; however, postoperative outcomes vary widely due to the effects of diverse factors. This research aims to explore the factors influencing postoperative outcomes of symptomatic DLM. Patients with DLM who underwent arthroscopic surgery at our hospital from 9/2008 to 9/2015 were enrolled according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fourteen variables, including sex, body mass index (BMI) and other variables, were chosen as factors for study. Knee function was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score. Univariate analyses (Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskall-Wallis rank sum test) and multivariate analyses (ordinal logistic regression) were used to identify the factors that influenced postoperative outcomes. P   24 months, IKDC scores for patients with symptoms duration ≤1 month (P = 0.001, OR = 3.511), 1 ~ 6 months (P < 0.001, OR = 3.463) and 6 ~ 24 months (P < 0.001, OR = 3.254) were significantly elevated. Compared to Outerbridge grade III ~ IV, no injury (P < 0.001, OR = 6.379) and grade I (P = 0.01, OR = 4.332) were associated with higher IKDC score. Arthroscopic treatment of symptomatic DLM is safe and effective, but its clinical efficacy is affected by many factors. Specifically, male sex, BMI < 18.5 kg/m2, age of onset < 25 years (especially < 14 years) and symptoms duration < 24 months are conducive to good postoperative outcomes. However, combined articular cartilage injury (Outbridge grade ≥ 2) reduces postoperative effect.

TI  - A randomized study of two physiotherapeutic approaches after knee ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2009
AB  - Little is known about whether physiotherapeutic knee classes provide additional benefits in the rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). In the present randomized study, we compare the results of a hospital-based programme, Knee-class Therapy (KT), with an individual programme with limited physiotherapy appointments, Guided Therapy (GT), 6 and 12 months after knee surgery, in terms of function, activity level, muscle strength, knee-joint stability and knee-joint mobility. After ACLR, 24 patients were randomized to the KT group and 27 to the GT group. Fourteen patients in the KT group and 24 in the GT group completed the physiotherapy appointments as prescribed. At 6 months after surgery, the median Lysholm knee score was significantly higher in the KT group. At the 12-month follow-up, the GT group's improvement in the Lysholm knee score was significantly greater than the KT group's. Non-compliance was high in the KT group. The subgroup analysis of the non-compliers in the KT ...

TI  - Technique Corner: Posterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries
PY  - 2021
AB  - Injuries of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) are, compared to other knee injuries, quite rare. They account for around 3% of all acute traumatic knee injuries. The underlying mechanism leading to a PCL injury is a posterior directed force onto the anterior proximal tibia causing posterior tibial translation. This occurs normally during high-velocity collisions as a “dashboard” injury as well as in competitive athletic sports such as football. Similar to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the PCL consist of two bundles (anterolateral and posteromedial) and is designed to prevent posterior translation of the tibia. The tension on the PCL differs according to the flexion angle of the knee. The diagnosis of PCL injuries is based on a careful clinical examination and radiological analysis. The radiological analysis consists of several X-rays with and without force loaded to the anterior proximal tibia, as well as an MRI which is considered the gold standard. CT scans can be performed to analyze for possible bony injuries. The treatment options include nonoperative treatment for isolated, partial PCL injuries and operative reconstruction for high-grade isolated PCL injuries or multiligamentous knee injuries. The surgical approach can be either open or arthroscopic, and similar to ACL reconstruction, a single or double bundle approach can be performed. Regarding the literature, there is no clear evidence for either double or single bundle reconstruction. Various PCL reconstruction techniques exist, including transtibial tunnel or a tibial-inlay technique. Common complications in PCL reconstruction include persistent posterior laxity and injury to the popliteal artery, the neurovascular structures, and meniscal roots during tunnel reaming. The postoperative treatment protocol includes restriction to 90° of flexion for the first 2 weeks with weight bearing as tolerated and the knee locked in extension, followed by free range of motion in a brace with weight bearing as tolerated. Physical therapy should focus on quadriceps muscle strengthening. Return to sports following PCL reconstruction should be delayed until 9–12 months from surgery.

TI  - Patient-assessed health instruments for the knee: a structured review
PY  - 2004
AB  - Objectives. To identify patient-assessed health instruments specific to the knee and review evidence for reliability, validity and responsiveness. Methods. Instruments were identified through systematic searches of the literature. Information relating to instrument content, patient population, reliability, validity and responsiveness was extracted from published papers. Results. The 16 instruments that met the inclusion criteria varied in length from 4 to 42 items. The majority form a single index; six produce a profile of scores. Eight have been evaluated in patients with a variety of knee problems. All instruments have satisfactory internal or test–retest reliability. However, there is limited empirical support for the health domains of six instruments. Patients informed the development of items within just five instruments. Few authors gave explicit consideration to the size of expected relationships in tests of construct validity. Eleven instruments have evidence for responsiveness to changes in health. The minimally important difference was not determined for any of the instruments. Conclusions. In the absence of comparative evidence, the large number of patient-assessed instruments for knee problems makes instrument selection difficult. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Knee Pain Scale and Oxford Knee Score have good evidence for reliability, content validity and construct validity. The KOOS and Oxford instruments also have evidence for responsiveness. The instruments have not been evaluated for all knee problems, and instrument appropriateness, including content relevance, must be assessed before application. The comparative evaluation of instruments is recommended.

TI  - Inertial sensors to quantify the pivot shift test in the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injury.
PY  - 2014
AB  - The main purpose of this article was to describe in detail, from the perspective of the clinical end user, a previously presented non-invasive methodology, applied in the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injury, in which inertial sensors are used to quantify the pivot shift test. The outcomes obtained and relative considerations were compared with findings emerging from a review of the relevant updated literature. The detailed description here provided covers the system, the parameters identified and the testing procedure; it also includes the technical specifications of the hardware, the features introduced in the updated version of the software and the application of the system in clinical practice. The comparison of the technical considerations and clinical results with the updated literature confirmed the system's optimal ergonomics, good reproducibility and clinical reliability. The novel approach here analyzed has been shown to overcome the weaknesses of other available devices and systems. Therefore, since it can be considered a new paradigm in the quantification of pivot shift test, we can recommend its routine use in clinical practice.

TI  - A comparison of results after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in female and male competitive athletes A two- to five-year follow-up of 429 patients
PY  - 1999
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the results after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in female and male competitive athletes who had a pre-injury Tegner activity level of > or =7 and a non-injured contralateral anterior cruciate ligament. One hundred and thirty-three female and 296 male patients were followed at 38 (21-68) months after the index operation. All the patients were operated on by experienced knee surgeons using patellar tendon autografts and interference screw fixation. At the index operation the median age of the female patients was 23 (1645) years and the median age of the male patients was 26 (16-47) years. The reconstruction was performed a median of 10 (0-141) and 10 (0-203) months after the injury in women and men respectively. The patients were re-examined by independent observers. At the follow-up, the median Lysholm score was 89 (38-100) points in the female group and 90 (22-100) points in the male group (P=0.015). The IKDC evaluation system, subjective anterior knee pain, subjective evaluation of the results, the knee-walking test and the KT-1000 tests revealed no differences between the groups. The mean (+/-2 SD) pre-injury Tegner activity level was 8.1 (+/-1.9) (median 8 (7-10)) in the female group and 8.4 (+/-1.8) (median 9 (7-10)) in the male group (P=0.003). At the follow-up, the Tegner activity level was 6.2 (+/-3.8) in the female group and 6.8 (+/-3.6) in the male group (P=0.012). At the follow-up, the Tegner activity level had decreased by 1.9 (+/-3.8) for the women and 1.6 (+/-3.3) for the men, as compared with the pre-injury level (n.s.). The difference between the performed and the desired activity level at the follow-up was 1.1 (+/-3.2) in the female group and 0.9 (+/-3.0) in the male group (n.s.). In the female group 53/133 (40%) and in the male group 115/296 (39%) returned to the pre-injury activity level (n.s.). The median one-leg-hop quotient was 93 (0-116)% in the female group and 96 (0-130)% in the male group (P=0.006). Concomitant meniscal injuries prior to the index operation, at the index operation or during the follow-up period were found in 64/133 (48%) women and in 185/ 296 (62%) men (P<0.01). The main conclusion was that the overall results in female and male athletes were comparable two to five years after the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. However, concomitant meniscal injuries were more common in male than females athletes after anterior cruciate ligament injuries.

TI  - Decreased Knee Joint Loading Associated With Early Knee Osteoarthritis After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background:Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury predisposes individuals to early-onset knee joint osteoarthritis (OA). Abnormal joint loading is apparent after ACL injury and reconstruction. The relationship between altered joint biomechanics and the development of knee OA is unknown.Hypothesis:Altered knee joint kinetics and medial compartment contact forces initially after injury and reconstruction are associated with radiographic knee OA 5 years after reconstruction.Study Design:Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:Individuals with acute, unilateral ACL injury completed gait analysis before (baseline) and after (posttraining) preoperative rehabilitation and at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after reconstruction. Surface electromyographic and knee biomechanical data served as inputs to an electromyographically driven musculoskeletal model to estimate knee joint contact forces. Patients completed radiographic testing 5 years after reconstruction. Differences in knee joint kinetics and conta...

PY  - 2012
AB  - Background:Although controversy continues over the choice of graft tissue, including autografts, allografts, and synthetic ligaments, for posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction, the use of a mixed graft consisting of a hamstring (semitendinosus and gracilis) autograft plus tibialis anterior allograft tendon has not been studied in detail.Hypothesis:Outcomes of PCL reconstructions performed with a mixed graft would be superior to those using solely an Achilles tendon allograft in terms of functional knee scores, posterior stability, and the graft appearance.Study design:Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.Methods:Fifty-eight patients who underwent isolated single-bundle PCL reconstruction using an arthroscopic trans-septal portal with remnant preservation technique were evaluated.

TI  - Meniscal tear--a feature of osteoarthritis.
PY  - 2004
AB  - Meniscectomy is recognized as an important risk factor for the development of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a disease that traditionally has been considered as a simple "wear and tear" phenomenon. However, despite numerous reports, little evidence has been presented that a limited meniscal resection, compared with a more extensive resection, reduces the risk of OA by preserving meniscal function. Why? This thesis provides one possible answer to that question. Patients, who had undergone isolated meniscal resection in 1973, 1978, or between 1983 and 1985 at Lund University Hospital, Sweden, were reviewed clinically and radiographically 15-22 years after the surgical procedure. Of the subjects (n = 317) almost 50% had developed radiographic OA in their operated knee, but just over half of these patients were symptomatic. An additional 20% of the patients had knee symptoms, but did not have radiographic knee OA. These results confirm a limited correlation between radiographic features of the disorder and symptoms. A degenerative type of meniscal tear and obesity were the factors most strongly associated with both radiographic knee OA and symptomatic radiographic knee OA. Partial meniscal resection induced less radiographic changes related to knee OA compared with total meniscectomy, but the patient-relevant outcomes remained essentially the same. If radiographic hand OA was present there was an increased likelihood of the patient also having knee OA following meniscectomy. This finding was independent of age, and therefore an inherited susceptibility to the disease contributes to the risk of knee OA after meniscal tear. Genetic and environmental risk factors interact in OA development. A degenerative meniscal lesion is often associated with early-stage knee OA, a disorder also involving the meniscal tissue. The tear may thus represent the first "signal" feature of OA. The challenge for the health professional is to discriminate between symptoms caused by a meniscal tear and those caused by OA. Meniscal resection may not benefit the patient with early-stage knee OA. The intervention merely removes evidence of the disorder, while the OA joint degradation proceeds.

TI  - A radiographic and histologic evaluation of the patellar tendon after harvesting its central third.
PY  - 2000
AB  - Nineteen consecutive patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the central third of the ipsilateral patellar tendon were included in the study. Serial magnetic resonance images revealed that the donor-site gap in the tendon decreased with time (mean follow-up, 26 months). The thickness was significantly increased compared with the intact contralateral patellar tendon, regardless of when the magnetic resonance imaging was performed. Ultrasonography showed the same findings at a mean follow-up of 26 months. Histologic evaluation of the repair tissue in the central part of the tendon, as well as the tissue in the peripheral part of the patellar tendon at the donor site, revealed a significant increase in cellularity and vascularity as compared with normal control tendons. Thus, 2 years after the harvesting procedure, the patellar tendon displayed significant radiographic and histologic abnormalities. On the basis of these findings, reharvest of the patellar tendon, at least up to 2 years after primary harvest, cannot be recommended.

TI  - How Should We Evaluate Outcomes for Use of Biologics in the Knee
PY  - 2014
AB  - In recent years, the use of biologics for the primary treatment and augmentation of treatment in patients with knee pathology has increased substantially. Techniques and applications for biologic preparations such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been developed and refined to increase the healing response in bone, ligaments, cartilage, meniscal tissue, and other areas of the knee. Beginning with basic science and animal models, and finally proceeding to clinical human trials, the effect of biologics on clinical outcomes has been widely studied; however, many results have been inconclusive on their true effectiveness. The purpose of this article is to review current strategies for evaluating outcomes after biologic treatment and to propose new recommendations for assessing outcomes following the use of biologics in the knee. In addition, the importance of study design, current challenges, and future directions will be reviewed to describe the current standards for future studies to follow.

TI  - Nonoperative Management of Minimally Displaced Patellar Sleeve Fractures.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Patellar sleeve fractures primarily occur in the adolescent population from a rapid contraction of the quadriceps with the knee in a flexed position. Several small case reports describe operative reduction and fixation for displaced fractures. However, there is sparse literature on nonoperative management of these injuries. Retrospective review and prospective follow-up of all patients diagnosed with patellar sleeve fracture between 1991 and 2014 at a single institution. Patients with superior pole avulsion fractures, history of prior knee surgery, and fractures managed operatively were excluded. Patients with a clinical diagnosis without support of advanced imaging were also excluded. Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were reviewed for initial fracture displacement, time until fracture union, and the presence of patellar tendon ossification. Outcome was assessed using the Tegner's activity scale, Kujala's Score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation score at final follow-up. Eighteen nonoperatively treated distal patellar pole sleeve fractures were identified, while five patients had advanced imaging to support their diagnosis. All were males with a mean age of 15.1 (range: 12-18). Traumatic and sport-related injuries were noted in the majority of patients. Only one patient had any appreciable displacement, but still < 2 mm. Final radiographic evaluation revealed fracture healing without patellar tendon ossification in all patients. All five patients had full terminal knee extension and symmetric range of motion. Mean IKDC score was 96.4 (range: 82-100) mean Tegner's activity score was 60 (range: 5-8), and mean Kujala's score was 89.7 (range: 63-100) at final follow-up. Of the five cases, three patients presented in a delayed fashion, and all went on to have surgical treatment. Two required arthroscopic loose body removal, while the other had an open patellar debridement and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection. Minimally displaced patellar sleeve fractures can be successfully managed nonoperatively with excellent clinical outcomes. However, delayed in presentation may be associated with worse outcome. This study of case series reflects level of evidence IV.

TI  - ACL reconstruction provides superior stability than ACL repair in patients with Schenck III and IV knee joint dislocations: first results of a 12 month follow-up study.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">Acute knee dislocation is a rare but devastating multi-ligamentous knee injury with only limited evidence-based surgical technique recommendations. The aim of this study was a comparison of two different anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration techniques as part of an early total surgical care concept: (1) repair of ACL with additional internal bracing (ACLIB) compared to; (2) ACL reconstruction with autograft (ACLR).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Retrospective, clinical-study of patients with an acute type III or IV knee dislocation (according to Schenck classification), in which the ACL was treated with ACLIB or ACLR within 12 days. The PCL was sutured and internally braced in all cases. Medial and lateral complex injuries were repaired and additionally laterally augmented by an Arciero reconstruction. After a minimum 12 months follow-up different patient-reported outcome measurements (IKDC, Lysholm, VAS, Tegner Score) and instrumental stability assessment by Rolimeter -test and stress radiographs (Telos<sup>™</sup>) were analyzed. Groups were compared by t test with p &lt; 0.05 considered significant.</AbstractText>

There were significant differences in instrumental stability testing (side-to-side difference (SSD) of anterior tibial translation: ACLIB 2.7 ± 1.5 mm vs. ACLR 1.3 ± 1.3; p = 0.0339) and stress radiography (SSD ACL: ACLIB 3.4 ± 2.2 mm vs. ACLR 0.4 ± 2.7; p = 0.0249) between groups. ACLIB group showed greater ROM in terms of flexion (SSD Flexion: ACLIB 7.8 ± 9.9° vs. ACLR 16 ± 7.0°; p = 0.0466; Total Flexion overall 125.5 ± 11.8°). No clinically relevant differences in patient-reported outcome scores (Lysholm Score: ACLIB 82 ± 16.4 vs. ACLR 85 ± 10.4; IKDC subjective score: ACLIB 70.4 ± 17 vs. ACLR 76.6 ± 8.3) were determined.</AbstractText>

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injured Copers and Noncopers: A Differential Response to Injury
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: Rupture of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) results in increased tibiofemoral laxity and usually disturbs neuromuscular function, thereby ultimately resulting in knee instability and dysfunction. However, ACL rupture does not automatically result in functional impairment and instability, as confirmed by the ACL deficient (ACLD) coper, who can resume pre-morbid activity levels. Few studies have shown that ACL reconstruction (ACLR) actually restores dynamic knee stability or enables full return to preinjury activity level in most individuals.Purpose: To review the dilemma regarding which ACL-injured individuals need to undergo ACLR.Study design: Meta-analysisMethods: Electronic searches of Medline, EMBase, CINAHL, and the Musculoskeletal Injuries Group’s specialized register were performed up to June 2009 using medical subject headings and free-text words. Subject-specific search was based on the terms “ ACL rehabilitation,” “copers,” and “noncopers.”Results: Three prospective, longitudinal trials have been undertaken following an ACL screening examination. Copers (non-operated) and noncopers (operated) have been followed over a few years post injury. The results show that a similar percentage of subjects in both groups return to sporting activity. Regarding the differences between copers and noncopers, there exists investigative evidence that noncopers have deficits in quadriceps strength, vastus lateralis atrophy, quadriceps activation deficits, altered knee movement patterns, reduced knee flexion moment, higher quadriceps/hamstring co-contraction, and a tendency to hold the tibia in a more posterior position.Conclusion: No single measurement tool is sufficient in determining the functional status of the ACLD individual. Passive instability tests are poor predictors of future rehabilitation outcome. A collaboration of tests to determine the functional status of the ACL deficient individual is recommended, specifically incorporating the KOS-Sport, Global Knee Function Rating, hop tests, and Quadriceps Index. The ACL screening examination shows preliminary evidence for detecting potential copers; however, a gold-standard method of detecting who will be successful is still lacking. ACL-injured subjects should be informed of the possibility of good knee function following a nonoperative rehabilitation program.

TI  - Minimum Two-Year Follow-up of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Patients with Generalized Joint Laxity
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background The purposes of this investigation were to compare outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction between patients with generalized joint laxity and those without it and to investigate the effect of generalized joint laxity on outcomes of ACL reconstruction from 2 to 8 years postoperatively. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 163 patients who had undergone unilateral ACL reconstruction from January 2001 to December 2008. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to presence or absence of generalized joint laxity. The proportions of patients with meniscectomy, graft rupture, and contralateral ACL rupture were compared. Rupture rates were compared with Kaplan-Meier analysis. The Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and anterior translation measured with the KT-2000 arthrometer were evaluated. The Lysholm knee score and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score were compared. The IKDC objective grade and radiographic grade were also evaluated. Follow-up assessments were performed at 2, 5, and 8 years postoperatively. Results The proportions of meniscectomy, graft rupture, and contralateral ACL rupture in patients with generalized joint laxity were higher than in patients without generalized joint laxity during the whole evaluation period. However, differences in proportions and cumulative rupture rates did not reach significance (p > 0.05). Patients with generalized joint laxity had less stability and poorer functional outcomes at the 8-year follow-up compared with patients without generalized joint laxity. With regard to the Lachman test and anterior translation, poorer results were shown in patients with generalized joint laxity than in patients without generalized joint laxity during the whole evaluation period. The results of pivot-shift testing differed significantly at 5 years (p = 0.002) and 8 years (p = 0.007). Patients with generalized joint laxity also had worse Lysholm knee scores and IKDC subjective scores during the whole evaluation period; these differences may not be clinically important. Comparisons between serial outcomes measured at 2, 5, and 8-year follow-ups within each patient group showed that anterior translation (p = 0.002), Lysholm knee score (p = 0.014), and IKDC subjective score (p = 0.002) deteriorated over time, although the values at 8 years were similar to those at 5 years, in patients with generalized joint laxity. Conclusions Generalized joint laxity as an inherent physiologic characteristic of patients was related to a significant adverse effect on stability and functional outcomes of ACL reconstruction for patients followed for 2 to 8 years. Generalized joint laxity should be considered a risk factor for poor outcomes after ACL reconstruction. Level of evidence Therapeutic Level III.

TI  - Landing strategies focusing on the control of tibial rotation in the initial contact period of one‐leg forward hops
PY  - 2016
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) surgeries successfully restore anterior tibial translation but not tibial rotation. This study aimed to explore landing strategies focusing on the control of tibial rotation at landing when the ACL is most vulnerable. Three groups of male subjects (50 ACLRs, 26 basketball players, and 31 controls) participated in one-leg forward hop tests for determining the tibial rotatory landing strategies adopted during the initial landing phase. The differences in knee kinematics and muscle activities between internal and external tibial rotatory (ITR, ETR) landing strategies were examined. A higher proportion of basketball players (34.6%) were found to adopt ITR strategies (controls: 6.5%), exhibiting significantly greater hopping distance and knee strength. After adjusting for hopping distance, subjects adopting ITR strategies were found to hop faster with straighter knees at foot contact and with greater ITR and less knee adduction angular displacement during the initial landing phase. However, significantly greater angular displacement in knee flexion, greater medial hamstring activities, and greater co-contraction index of hamstrings and medial knee muscles were also found during initial landing. Our results support the importance of the recruitments of medial hamstrings or the local co-contraction in assisting the rotatory control of the knee during initial landing for avoiding ACL injuries.

TI  - Actifit® polyurethane meniscal scaffold: MRI and functional outcomes after a minimum follow-up of 5 years.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Background Implantation of the Actifit® polyurethane meniscal scaffold in patients who have pain after partial meniscectomy provides short-term pain relief and better function. But there is a lack of information about medium-term outcomes. The objective of this longitudinal study was to evaluate the MRI and functional outcomes after a minimum follow-up of 5 years. It was hypothesized that the results are stable over time. Material and methods Fifteen consecutive patients (8 men, 7 women; mean age 30 years, range 19–47, mean BMI 25) were enrolled in the study between February 2008 and January 2011. Five patients also underwent ACL reconstruction and one underwent mosaicplasty. Nine lateral and six medial Actifit® implants were evaluated prospectively before the surgery and at a minimum of 12, 24 and 60 months’ follow-up using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, the objective and subjective IKDC scores, radiological and MRI analysis with measurement of the ICRS score, Genovese score and extrusion. Results The mean follow-up was 6 years (range 5–8.1). Two patients were lost to follow-up. Three patients were re-operated at 7, 19 and 30 months because they had not improved functionally and the implant appeared damaged on MRI. Partial removal of the implant did not improve the functional outcomes (mean subjective IKDC pre- and post-revision: 37.0 vs. 34.9). Two patients were lost to follow-up. In intention to treat (13 cases), the pain (VAS) and subjective IKDC score were improved between the preoperative period and the last follow-up (5.46 vs. 2.92, P = 0.007 and 51.2 vs. 66.1, P = 0.05). In per protocol (10 cases, failures excluded), the pain (VAS) and subjective IKDC score were improved (5.3 vs. 1.9, P = 0.0009; 49.6 vs. 75.4, P = 0.002) along with the pain, daily activities and quality of life components of the KOOS (60.6 vs. 86.0, P = 0.0008; 70.3 vs. 90.2, P = 0.001; 42.7 vs. 71.0, P = 0.0058). The functional scores were stable between months 12, 24 and 60. ICRS cartilage score and mean meniscal extrusion were unchanged at the last follow-up (1.6 vs. 1.6 and 2.41 vs. 2.79). In all patients, the meniscal implant had an intermediate signal and reduced size on MRI. Discussion Despite an abnormal MRI appearance suggesting the meniscal scaffold is not fully mature after 5 years, the functional scores and cartilage status are stable at this time point. However, the failure rate is still high and removing the implant in patients with poor function does not improve the outcome. Type of study Prospective cohort study Level IV.

TI  - Dynamic Evaluation of Pivot-Shift Phenomenon in Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Triaxial Accelerometer
PY  - 2016
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the effect of initial graft tension on rotational stability and to determine the minimum required tension (MRT) based on the pivot-shift phenomenon in isolated anteromedial bundle (AMB), isolated posteromedial bundle (PLB), and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions using a triaxial accelerometer during surgery. Methods Primary double-bundle ACL reconstructions were included. The pivot-shift test and N-test were performed before and during surgery with the acceleration measurements using a triaxial accelerometer. The pivot-shift test was also manually graded. The AMB and PLB were fixed to a graft tensioning system during surgery with the following settings: (1) AMB only (AMB), (2) PLB only (PLB), and (3) AMB and PLB (A+P). The total graft tension was first set at 20 N and then was increased in increments of 10 N until the pivot-shift test became negative, which was defined as the MRT in each setting. Results Twenty-five patients were evaluated. The MRT in the AMB setting averaged 26 N (range, 20 to 40 N); in the PLB setting, 28 N (range, 20 to 40 N); and in the A+P setting, 24 N (range, 20 to 40 N). The MRT in the A+P setting was significantly smaller than that in the PLB setting ( P  = .008). The acceleration in the A+P setting was significantly smaller than that in the AMB and PLB settings both in the pivot-shift test (vs AMB: P  = .007, vs PLB: P  = .011) and in the N-test (vs AMB: P P Conclusions Double-bundle ACL reconstruction better controlled rotational stability with smaller MRT than isolated PLB reconstruction at the time of surgery. In double-bundle reconstruction, the MRT based on the pivot-shift phenomenon could be larger than previously reported MRT based on anteroposterior laxity. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Validity and reliability of Thai version of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Background: Self-administered questionnaires have become an important aspect for clinical outcome assessment of knee-related surgery. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form is a knee-specific questionnaire that is widely used and translated to many languages. The purposes of the present study were: (1) to translate the questionnaire into Thai; and (2) to assess the validity and reliability of the Thai version of the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form. Material and Method: The IKDC Subjective Knee Form was translated into Thai using forward-backward translation protocol. Afterward, reliability and validity were tested. The responses of 55 consecutive patients on two questionnaires, the Thai IKDC Subjective Knee Form and the Short Form-36, were used. The validity was tested by correlating the scores from both questionnaires. The reliability was adopted by measuring the test-retest reliability and internal consistency. Results: The Thai IKDC Subjective Knee Form showed good correlations with the physical functioning and bodily pain domains of the SF-36 (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.75 and 0.76 respectively). The reliability proved excellent with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.92 for test-retest. The internal consistency was strong (Cronbach alpha = 0.92). Conclusion: The Thai version of IKDC Subjective Knee Form showed good value to retain the characteristic of the original version. In addition, it was a reliable evaluation instrument for patients with knee-related problems.

TI  - Effect of Notchplasty in Anatomic Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background:The effects of notchplasty on the clinical outcome after anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction remain unclear.Hypothesis:Anatomic ACL reconstruction with notchplasty would result in less risk of loss of extension and would provide adequate space for better graft healing, leading to better knee stability compared with anatomic ACL reconstruction without notchplasty.Study Design:Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:A total of 137 patients who underwent anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction were included. Seventy-three patients without notchplasty were classified as the control group, and 64 patients with 2-mm notchplasty were classified as the notchplasty group. The following evaluation methods were used: loss of extension, patient’s subjective feeling of limited extension and pain at passive full extension, muscle strength, manual laxity tests, KT-1000 arthrometer measurement, patellofemoral joint findings, Tegner score, Lysholm score, subjective scores...

TI  - Preoperative predictors for noncopers to pass return to sports criteria after ACL reconstruction.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Less than 50% of athletes pass criteria to return to sports (RTS) 6 months after ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Using data on 38 noncopers, we hypothesized that preoperative age, quadriceps strength index (QI), and knee flexion moments (KFM) during gait would predict the ability to pass/fail RTS criteria and that preoperative quadriceps strength gains would be predictive of passing RTS criteria. Gait analysis and strength data were collected before and after a preoperative intervention and 6 months after ACLR. Age, QI, and KFM each contributed to the predictability to pass or fail RTS criteria 6 months after ACLR. Collectively, the variables predict 69% who would pass and 82% who would fail RTS criteria 6 months after ACLR. Younger athletes who have symmetrical quadriceps strength and greater KFM were more likely to pass RTS criteria. Further, 63% of those who increased preoperative quadriceps strength passed RTS criteria, whereas 73% who did not failed. Increasing quadriceps strength in noncopers before ACLR seems warranted.

TI  - Kinematics and laxity of the knee joint after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: pre- and postoperative radiostereometric studies.
PY  - 2002
AB  - Background: Injury of the anterior cruciate ligament changes the kinematics of the knee joint. In studies of cadaveric knees, investigators have examined the effect of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on knee kinematics, but the effect on dynamic knee motion is not known.Hypothesis: Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament restores knee kinematics to normal.Study Design: Prospective cohort study.Methods: Nine patients were examined preoperatively and 1 year after reconstruction. Continuous radiostereometric exposures were performed at a speed of two to four exposures per second while the patients ascended an 8-cm high platform. Tibial rotation and tibial and femoral translation were measured with radiostereometric analysis.Results: Tibial rotation and tibial and femoral translation were not significantly different after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction compared with preoperative measurements. A radiostereometric evaluation of anterior knee laxity revealed restoration to within 1 ...

PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">There are few sports-specific knee functional scales in the Arabic language. The Knee Outcome Survey-Sports Activities Scale (KOS-SAS) is a validated sports-specific patient-reported outcome measure that assesses knee function in an athletic population.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Purpose" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To provide a validated Arabic version of the KOS-SAS (KOS-SAS-Ar) while achieving cross-cultural adaptation for use in an Arabic-speaking population with sports-related knee disorders.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Study Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">There were 2 independent translators who conducted a forward translation of the KOS-SAS, followed by a backward translation by different translators. Subsequently, researchers and expert invitees judged the conceptual content and cultural adaptations of the final translation. A total of 276 patients completed the KOS-SAS-Ar as well as the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective assessment of knee function and a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Statistical analysis was performed for test-retest reliability, convergent validity, construct validity, and factor analysis.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The test-retest reliability of the KOS-SAS-Ar was high (<i>r</i> = 0.9). The items of the KOS-SAS-Ar had statistically significant internal consistency, with a Cronbach alpha of .924 (<i>P</i> &lt; .0001). The KOS-SAS-Ar Symptoms subscore correlated with the VAS pain score (<i>P</i> &lt; .0001), and the KOS-SAS-Ar Functional Limitations subscore correlated with the IKDC subjective score (<i>P</i> &lt; .0001). The construct validity of the KOS-SAS-Ar was satisfactory (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value = 0.868; Bartlett test: <i>P</i> &lt; .0001). Factor analysis showed a statistical correlation among the 11 items of the KOS-SAS-Ar.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The KOS-SAS-Ar demonstrated favorable reliability and validity, and it appears to be a suitable tool for Arabic-speaking patients with sports-related knee conditions.</AbstractText>

TI  - Primary anterior cruciate ligament repair-morphological and quantitative assessment by 7-T MRI and clinical outcome after 1.5 years.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVES" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The purpose of this study was to assess morphological and quantitative changes of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and cartilage after ACL repair.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">7T MRI of the knee was acquired in 31 patients 1.5 years after ACL repair and in 13 controls. Proton density-weighted images with fat saturation (PD-fs) were acquired to assess ACL width, signal intensity, elongation, and fraying. T2/T2* mapping was performed for assessment of ACL and cartilage. Segmentation of the ACL, femoral, and tibial cartilage was carried out at 12 ROIs. The outcome evaluation consisted of the Lysholm Knee Score and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score and clinical examination.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">ACL showed a normal signal intensity in 96.8% and an increased width in 76.5% after repair. Fraying occurred in 22.6% without having an impact on the clinical outcome (Lysholm score: 90.39 ± 9.75, p = 0.76 compared to controls). T2 analysis of the ACL revealed no difference between patients and controls (p = 0.74). Compared to controls, assessment of the femoral and tibial cartilage showed a significant increase of T2* times in all ROIs, except at the posterolateral femur. Patients presented a good outcome in clinical examination with a Lysholm score of 87.19 ± 14.89 and IKDC of 80.23 ± 16.84.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">T2 mapping results suggest that the tissue composition of the ACL after repair is similar to that of a native ACL after surgery, whereas the ACL exhibits an increased width. Fraying of the ACL can occur without having any impact on functional outcomes. T2* analysis revealed early degradation at the cartilage.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">MRI represents a noninvasive diagnostic tool for the morphological and compositional assessment of the anterior cruciate ligament after repair, whereas knowledge about post-surgical alterations is crucial for adequate imaging interpretation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="KEY POINTS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">• There has been renewed interest in repairing the anterior cruciate ligament with a proximally torn ligament. • T2 times of the anterior cruciate ligament do not differ between anterior cruciate ligament repair patients and controls. • T2 mapping may serve as a surrogate for the evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament after repair.</AbstractText>

TI  - Effect of Lateral Extra-Articular Procedures Combined With ACL Reconstruction on the Rate of Graft Rupture in Patients Aged Older Than 30 Years: A Matched-Pair Analysis of 1102 Patients From the SANTI Study Group.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Clinical studies have demonstrated significant advantages of combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) and lateral extra-articular procedures (LEAPs) over isolated ACLR in terms of reducing graft rupture and reoperation rates. However, most of the published studies have included young patients, and no studies have focused on patients aged &gt;30 years.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of isolated ACLR versus ACLR + LEAP at midterm follow-up in patients aged &gt;30 years. The hypothesis was that patients who underwent combined procedures would experience significantly lower rates of graft rupture.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Patients &gt;30 years of age who underwent primary ACLR + LEAP between January 2003 and December 2020 were propensity matched at a 1:1 ratio to patients who underwent isolated ACLR. A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed to determine graft rupture rates, knee stability, reoperation rates, and complications. Graft survivorship was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors associated with the occurrence of graft failure were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Two groups of 551 patients each were included in the study, and the mean follow-up was 97.19 ± 47.23 months. The overall mean age was 37.01 ± 6.24 years. The LEAP group consisted of 503 (91.3%) patients who had anterolateral ligament reconstruction and 48 (8.7%) patients who had a Lemaire procedure. Overall, 19 (1.7%) patients had graft failure: 15 (2.7%) in the no-LEAP group and 4 (0.7%) in the LEAP group (<i>P</i> = .0116). The risk of graft failure was significantly associated with the absence of LEAP (31 vs 12; hazard ratio, 3.309; 95% CI, 1.088-10.065; <i>P</i> = .0350) and age between 30 and 35 years (hazard ratio, 4.533; 95% CI, 1.484-13.841; <i>P</i> = .0080). A higher rate of reoperation for secondary meniscectomy was found in the no-LEAP group (5.6% vs 2.2%; <i>P</i> = .0031).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Patients aged &gt;30 years who underwent combined ACLR and LEAP experienced a &gt;3-fold lower risk of ACL graft failure compared with those who underwent isolated ACLR. Furthermore, the group without LEAP experienced a higher rate of secondary meniscectomy.</AbstractText>

TI  - Comparison of surgical repair or reconstruction of the cruciate ligaments versus nonsurgical treatment in patients with traumatic knee dislocations.
PY  - 2002
AB  - Background:Studies of traumatic knee dislocations have failed to provide a consensus regarding the best method of treatment.Purpose:Our purpose was to evaluate the results after surgical repair or reconstruction versus nonsurgical treatment and to compare the influence of prognostic factors.Study Design:Retrospective study.Methods:Eighty-nine patients were treated for traumatic knee dislocation. Surgical repair or reconstruction of the cruciate ligaments was performed in 63 patients (repair, 49; reconstruction, 14). In 26 patients, nonsurgical treatment was undertaken.Results:At an average follow-up of 8.2 years, the mean Lysholm and Tegner scores were 75 and 3.7, respectively. The outcome in the surgical group was better than in the nonsurgical group. The scores were higher in patients who were 40 years of age or younger, who had sports injuries rather than motor vehicle accident injuries, and who had undergone functional rehabilitation rather than immobilization.Conclusions:Surgical repair or reconstruc...

TI  - Predictors of pain and function outcome after rehabilitation in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Objective: To identify changes in impairments associated with functional and pain outcome in patients with patello­ femoral pain syndrome following a standardized physi­ otherapy treatment. Design: One group pre­post design. Subjects: Seventy­four patients (median age 27 years, 52% female) diagnosed with patellofemoral pain syndrome and referred to physiotherapy treatment. Methods: Baseline measures included self­reported function and pain, which were the dependent variables, and meas­ ures of independent variables: strength of quadriceps, hip abduction and hip external rotation; length of hamstrings, quadriceps, plantar flexors, iliotibial band/tensor fascia lata complex, and lateral retinaculum; quality of movement, and fear­avoidance beliefs. Following the baseline measurements, subjects participated in a standardized physiotherapy pro­ gram. Measurements were repeated at 2­month follow­up. Data were analyzed using 2 forward regression models, the first using function outcome, and the second using pain out­ come as the criterion. Age, gender, height and weight were controlled in the regression models. Results: Change in fear­avoidance beliefs about physical ac­ tivity and change in gastrocnemius length predicted function outcome. Change in fear­avoidance beliefs about physical activity and about work predicted outcome of pain. Conclusion: Change in fear­avoidance beliefs about physi­ cal activity was the strongest predictor of function and pain outcome. The fact that patients who decreased their fear­ avoidance beliefs improved function and decreased pain indicates that perhaps fear­avoidance beliefs should be tar­ geted during the treatment of patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

TI  - Return to sport and work after medial open wedge high tibial osteotomy : a case series.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Data on return to work and sport following open wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO) have been underreported. Furthermore, there is no clear consensus in literature about the postoperative alignment goals following HTO. A retrospective case series was performed to evaluate return to sport and work following open wedge HTO. The University of California, Los Angeles scale, the German classification system according to the Reichsausschus fur Arbeitszeitermittlung, the Tegner score and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score were used to asses the employment status, sport status and clinical outcome at the time of surgery and at final follow-up, minimum 2 years after surgery. The pre- and postoperative hip knee ankle angle (HKA) were documented. The desired postoperative alignment target was 0°-2° valgus mechanical axis. 30 open wedge HTOs were performed of which 27 patients were retrospectively included in the study. 25 out of 26 patients returned to work and 15 out of 17 patients returned to sport following surgery. Outcome scores were significantly higher after surgery. The mean postoperative HKA was 0,9° of valgus mechanical axis. This study shows excellent outcome in sport and work activity and clinical outcome after open wedge HTO. We furthermore suggest that these outcomes can be obtained with a postoperative alignment of 0°-2° of valgus mechanical axis.

TI  - Gait Mechanics and Second ACL Rupture: Implications for Delaying Return-to-Sport
PY  - 2016
AB  - Second anterior cruciate ligament rupture is a common and devastating injury among young women who return to sport after ACL reconstruction, but it is inadequately understood. The purpose of this study was to compare gait biomechanics and return-to-sport time frames in a matched cohort of young female athletes who, after primary ACLR, returned to sport without re-injury or sustained a second ACL injury. Approximately 6 months after primary reconstruction, 14 young women (age 16 ± 2 years) involved in jumping, cutting, and pivoting sports underwent motion analysis testing after physical therapy and impairment resolution. Following objective return-to-sport clearance, seven athletes sustained a second ACL rupture within 20 months of surgery (13.4 ± 4.9 months). We matched them by age, sex, and sport-level to seven athletes who returned to sports without re-injury. Data were analyzed using a previously validated, EMG-informed, patient-specific musculoskeletal model. Compared to athletes without re-injury, athletes who sustained a second ACL injury received surgery sooner (p = 0.023), had post-operative impairments resolved earlier (p = 0.022), reached criterion-based return-to-sport benchmarks earlier (p = 0.024), had higher body mass index (p = 0.039), and walked with lower peak knee flexor muscle forces bilaterally (p = 0.021). Athletes who sustained a second injury also tended to walk with larger (p = 0.089) and more symmetrical peak knee flexion angles and less co-contraction, all indicative of a more normal gait pattern. Statement of Clinical Significance: Delayed return-to-sport clearance even in the absence of gait or clinical impairments following primary ACL reconstruction may be necessary to mitigate second ACL injury risk in young women. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in patients with anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency undergoing arthroscopic reconstruction: a practice-based Italian normative group in comorbid-free patients.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Background
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insufficiency has not been assessed in comorbid-free patients to date. An observational study was therefore conducted on a practice-based sample to test the hypothesis that SF-36 scoring in patients with chronic ACL insufficiency differs from the age- and gender-matched Italian norm.

TI  - Reconstructions multiligamentaires du genou par allogreffes : résultats cliniques et laxité postopératoire objective
PY  - 2020
AB  - Resume Introduction Le traitement chirurgical des lesions multiligamentaires (MLKIs) est actuellement prefere au traitement fonctionnel mais il persiste des interrogations concernant la meilleure strategie chirurgicale. Le meilleur moment pour operer, des greffes autologues ou heterologues, une chirurgie en un temps ou en sequentielle. Le but de cette etude etait d’evaluer les resultats laximetriques des reconstructions multiligamentaires par allogreffes en un temps. L’hypothese etait que l’utilisation de ces allogreffes congelees et non irradiees donne une laxite residuelle faible et des resultats cliniques satisfaisants. Methode Entre novembre 2013 et juillet 2015, 23 patients presentant une MLKIs ont eu une reconstruction multiligamentaire en un temps par allogreffe. La classification utilisee etait celle de Schenk (KD). Les resultats fonctionnels etaient evalues par les scores de KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score), de Lysholm, et IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form) au recul minimum de 24 mois. Les laxites postoperatoires comparatives ont ete evaluees par radiographies en stress (valgus, varus, tiroir anterieur et posterieur) et exprimees en millimetres de differentielle (SSD) pour chaque laxite operee. Resultats Trois patients ont ete perdus de vue. Il y avait 6 lesions KD-I, 12 KD-II et 2 KD-IV, 12 lesions laterales et 10 mediales, 13 lesions aigues et 7 chroniques. Trois patients presentaient des lesions neurovasculaires associees. Le recul moyen etait de 29,4 ± 6,1 mois. La differentielle de laxite moyenne en valgus force etait de 0,2 mm ± 1,4 mm (−2,1–2,2 mm), de 1,4 mm ± 2,5 mm (−1,7–6,0 mm) en varus force. Le tiroir posterieur moyen differentiel etait de 7,2 mm ± 3,9 mm (1,2–16,0 mm), de 3,6 mm ± 5,1 mm pour le tiroir anterieur (−4,8–16,8 mm). L’IKDC objectif etait reparti comme suit : 4 grade A, 3B, 7C, et 6D. Trois patients se plaignaient d’instabilite residuelle. Le score IKDC subjectif postoperatoire moyen au recul etait de 67,2 ± 19,6, Le score Lysholm de 77,3 ± 16,5. Le profil moyen des parametres KOOS etait de 78,5 ± 16,6 pour la douleur, 67,7 ± 17,4 pour les symptomes, 86,5 ± 14,2 pour les activites quotidiennes, 56 ± 25,4 pour les sports, 47,2 ± 28,6 pour la qualite de vie. Dix-neuf patients ont refait du sport, 6 au meme niveau. Un patient a eu une arthrolyse arthroscopique pour raideur residuelle. Conclusions Les reconstructions multiligamentaires du genou en un temps par allogreffe non irradiee sont fiables et efficaces. Il persiste frequemment une laxite anteroposterieure mais les patients retrouvent une vie quotidienne normale et parfois la capacite de reprendre leurs sports au meme niveau.

TI  - Treatment of medial-sided injuries in patients with early bicruciate ligament reconstruction for knee dislocation
PY  - 2020
AB  - In knee dislocation with bicruciate ligament and medial side injury (KDIIIM), treatment method of medial side injuries is controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of non-operative treatment of proximal and midsubstance and operative treatment of distal avulsion medial collateral ligament (MCL) ruptures in patients with early bicruciate reconstruction. One-hundred and forty-seven patients with a knee dislocation and bicruciate ligament injury (KDII-KDV) were identified. Sixty-two patients had KDIIIM injury. Of these, 24 patients were excluded and 13 were lost to follow-up. With a minimum of 2 years of follow-up, IKDC2000 (subjective and objective), Lysholm and Tegner scores and stress radiographs were recorded. Twenty-five patients were available for follow-up: 18 had a proximal or midsubstance grade-III MCL rupture (proximal MCL group) and 7 had a distal MCL avulsion (distal MCL group). In the proximal MCL and distal MCL groups, respectively, median IKDC2000 subjective scores were 80 (range 57–99) and 62 (range 39–87), and median Lysholm scores were 88 (range 57–99) and 75 (range 40–100). The median medial opening (side-to-side difference) was 2.4 mm (range 0.1–9.2) in the proximal MCL group and 2.5 mm (range 0.2–4.8) in the distal MCL group. We found acceptable recorded outcomes in patients who underwent non-operative treatment of proximal and midsubstance grade-III MCL rupture and operative treatment of distal MCL avulsion with early bicruciate ligament reconstruction.

TI  - Short-term functional outcomes of a delayed single-stage reconstruction of chronic posterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner deficiency.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Aims
To evaluate the functional outcomes of a delayed (>6 months post-injury) and combined reconstruction of grade III posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and grade III posterolateral corner (PLC) deficiencies.

Patients and Methods
Between March 2006 and October 2009, a delayed surgery consisting of arthroscopically-assisted PCL reconstruction and open reconstruction of the PLC was performed on 19 men and 2 women (average age, 29 years). The mean time-to-surgery was 18 months (range, 7–51 months) and duration of follow-up was 22 months (range, 12–48 months). Postoperatively, patients were evaluated using Lysholm score, Tegner activity score, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective and objective scores.

Results
At the final follow-up, majority of the knees (61.9%) achieved either normal or nearly normal rating objective IKDC score. The means of IKDC subjective score, Lysholm score and Tegner activity level were 62.09, 74.35 and 5.14 respectively. One patient was able to participate in competitive sport, 5 patients were able to be involved in recreational sports for at least 5 times per week, 10 patients were able to perform heavy labour and recreational sports for at least twice weekly, 4 patients were able to engage in moderately heavy labour work and one patient was only able to perform light labour work. There was no significant statistical association found between the time-to-surgery and the final patients’ outcomes.

Conclusions
A delayed simultaneous reconstruction of chronic grade III PCL and PLC deficiencies can restore sufficient function for standard daily and recreational sports activities to the patients

TI  - Autograft Demonstrates Superior Outcomes for Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction When Compared With Allograft: A Systematic Review.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Multiple studies have compared outcomes among patients undergoing revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with autograft versus allograft, but these data are inconsistently reported and long-term outcomes depending on graft type are yet to be determined.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To perform a systematic review of clinical outcomes after revision ACLR (rACLR) with autograft versus allograft.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A systematic review of the literature was performed by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase to identify studies that compared the outcomes of patients undergoing rACLR with autograft versus allograft. The search phrase used was <i>autograft allograft revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction</i>. Graft rerupture rates, return-to-sports rates, anteroposterior laxity, and patient-reported outcome scores (subjective International Knee Documentation Committee, Tegner, Lysholm, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) were evaluated.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Eleven studies met inclusion criteria, including 3011 patients undergoing rACLR with autograft (mean age, 28.9 years) and 1238 patients undergoing rACLR with allograft (mean age, 28.0 years). Mean follow-up was 57.3 months. The most common autograft and allograft types were bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts. Overall, 6.2% of patients undergoing rACLR experienced graft retear, including 4.7% in the autograft group and 10.2% in the allograft group (<i>P</i> &lt; .0001). Among studies that reported return-to-sports rates, 66.2% of patients with an autograft returned to sports as opposed to 45.3% of patients with an allograft (<i>P</i> = .01). Two studies found significantly greater postoperative knee laxity in the allograft group as compared with the autograft group (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). Among all patient-reported outcomes, 1 study found 1 significant difference between groups: patients with an autograft had a significantly higher postoperative Lysholm score when compared with patients with an allograft.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Patients undergoing revision ACLR with an autograft can be expected to experience lower rates of graft retear, higher rates of return to sports, and less postoperative anteroposterior knee laxity when compared with patients undergoing revision ACLR with an allograft.</AbstractText>

TI  - Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament repair for proximal anterior cruciate ligament tears in skeletally immature patients: Surgical technique and preliminary results.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Background Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears in children are increasingly common and present difficult treatment decisions due to the risk of growth disturbance. Although open primary ACL repair was abandoned in the historical literature, recent studies have suggested that there is a role for arthroscopic primary repair in patients with proximal tears. Methods This is a retrospective review of five consecutive patients aged 9.2 years (range 8 to 10) who underwent suture anchor ACL reinsertion. Patients were included if they were Tanner stages 1–2 and proximal ACL tears with adequate tissue quality confirmed arthroscopically. The time frame was 81 days. Arthroscopic ACL reinsertion was performed with bioabsorbable suture anchor. Clinical evaluation, KT-1000™, and MRI were re-evaluated. Clinical outcomes were measured using International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm and Tegner activity score. Results At a mean follow-up of 43.4 months (range 25 to 56), no re-injury and leg length discrepancies were observed. Four patients had negative Lachman tests. The remainder had a grade 1 Lachman test. The mean side-to-side difference was 3 (2–4 mm). In MRI obtained at the last follow-up, no articular lesions or growth arrest were observed and the reinserted ACL was recognized in every exam. All patients returned to previous level of activity and presented normal and nearly normal IKDC score. The mean Lysholm score was 93.6. Conclusion Arthroscopic ACL repair can achieve good short-term results with joint stability and recovery of sport activity in skeletally immature patients, with proximal ACL avulsion tear.

PY  - 2004
AB  - Objetivo Analizar de forma prospectiva la eficacia, seguridad y coste-efectividad del procedimiento de reconstruccion artroscopica del ligamento cruzado anterior en regimen de cirugia mayor ambulatoria. Material y metodo Entre noviembre de 2001 y diciembre de 2002 se realizaron 96 reconstrucciones del ligamento cruzado anterior, utilizando autoinjertos hueso-tendon-hueso o isquiotibiales en 4 haces. Se realizaron gestos quirurgicos adicionales en 39 pacientes. Los resultados se valoraron a los 5 dias del postoperatorio mediante la escala de dolor visual analogica (EVA) y encuesta de control del dolor, y se reevaluaron a los 6 meses estudiando el resultado clinico segun el cuestionario del International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), tasa de complicaciones, satisfaccion de los pacientes y coste-efectividad del proceso. Resultados A los 5 dias postoperatorios el 88,5% de pacientes refirieron un buen nivel analgesico (EVA de 1,9 ± 0,4). Ningun paciente requirio reingreso para control del dolor. A los 6 meses el IKDC era normal o casi normal en el 90,6% de pacientes y un 89,5% se mostraron satisfechos con el procedimiento ambulatorio. El ahorro economico por paciente fue del 7,9% cuando se comparo con la cirugia con ingreso. Conclusiones Los resultados sugieren que la reconstruccion del ligamento cruzado anterior puede realizarse con seguridad de forma ambulatoria. Los analgesicos orales han resultado adecuados para el control domiciliario del dolor postoperatorio. El analisis economico demostro el costeefectividad del procedimiento.

TI  - Relationship Between Markers of Type II Collagen Metabolism and Tibiofemoral Joint Space Width Changes After ACL Injury and Reconstruction
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background:Those who suffer anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) disruptions are at increased risk of experiencing posttraumatic osteoarthritis (OA); however, by the time they become symptomatic, irreversible damage has likely occurred. Little is known regarding the physiological changes in articular cartilage that occur after an ACL injury and the onset of OA.Purpose:To assess whether patient, functional, and clinical outcomes and type II collagen metabolism are associated with abnormal tibiofemoral joint space width (JSW) 4 years after injury and reconstruction.Study Design:Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.Methods:A total of 35 ACL-injured patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were enrolled soon after injury, as were 32 matched controls. At baseline and 1- and 4-year follow-ups, patient-oriented subjective and objective outcomes and markers of type II collagen metabolism (considered as the ratio of cleavage to synthesis of type II collagen) were evaluated, as were radiographic measurements of JSW chan...

TI  - Mid- to Long-term Results of Single-Bundle Versus Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Randomized Controlled Trial
PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the mid-to long-term results of a randomized controlled trial of single-bundle (SB) versus double-bundle (DB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using a semitendinosus tendon. Methods Seventy-eight patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction with an autologous semitendinosus tendon were prospectively randomized into 2 groups: SB reconstruction (n = 39) and DB reconstruction (n = 39). In both groups, grafts were fixed at 30° of flexion with a total tension of 80 N. The following evaluation methods were used: clinical examination, KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) measurement, muscle strength, Tegner activity score, Lysholm score, subjective rating scale regarding patient satisfaction and sports performance level, graft retear, contralateral ACL tear, and additional meniscus surgery. Results Fifty-three patients (25 in SB group and 28 in DB group) who were followed up for a minimum of 3 years (mean, 69 months; range, 36 to 140 months) were evaluated. Preoperatively, there were no differences between the groups. Postoperatively, the Lachman and pivot-shift test results were better in the DB group ( P  = .024 and P v 2.7 mm; P  = .0023). The Tegner score was also better in the DB group ( P  = .033). There were no significant differences in range of motion, muscle strength, Lysholm score, subjective rating scale, graft retear, and secondary meniscal tear. Conclusions In ACL reconstruction using the transtibial approach, DB reconstruction was significantly better than SB reconstruction regarding anterior and rotational stability during the 3- to 12-year follow-up. The results of KT measurements and the Lachman and pivot-shift tests were significantly better in the DB group, whereas there was no difference in the anterior drawer test results. The Tegner score was also better in the DB group; however, there were no differences in the other subjective findings. Level of Evidence Level II, lesser-quality prospective randomized trial.

TI  - Correlation between radiological and clinical findings after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2006
AB  - Introduction. In the last two decades, the gold standard for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft procedure. Correct position of the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft significantly affects the postoperative knee stability. The aim of this study was to establish if and how clinically measured knee stability is associated with radiographic position of bone-patellar tendon-bone graft in the femoral and tibial bones. Material and methods. The prospective study included 39 patients, 30 men and 9 women. We analyzed and compared results of clinical and radiographic examinations prior to and 2 years following surgery. Results. The mean arthrometric difference between the anterior tibial movement prior to surgery was 11,2mm and 2,4mm (p<0,05) after surgery. The preoperative Tegner and Lysholm score was 1,49, and postoperative 8,23 (p<0,05). The preoperative Lysholm-Gillquist scale was 51,56 and postoperative 97,74 (p<0,05). The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were as follows: grade A in 32 patients (84.6%), grade B in 5 patients (12.8%), and grade C in 1 patient (2.6%). By comparison of IKDC scores and radiographic parameters (M1 - M10) of anterior-posterior and profile views, a statistical significance was found only between IKDC and M9 index (sagittal femoral index OR’/RR’ x 100). Discussion. By using bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts, it is not possible to entirely achieve anatomical positions. Correct graft position within the bone tunnels is of great significance concerning knee stability after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Conclusion. Correlation between radiological and clinical findings after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in our 39 patients shows that only the position of the graft affects the clinical outcome. Posterior graft location provides better clinical outcome and knee stability. On the other hand, anterior location is associated with worse postoperative IKDC scores, unstable knee and worse clinical outcome. .

TI  - Return to sports and re-rupture rate following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in amateur sportsman: long-term outcomes.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate patient satisfaction, the return-to-sport rate and activity level at a long-term follow-up in a large cohort of amateur sportsmen who underwent primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods A total of 218 patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction between 2004 and 2011, were successfully recontacted and retrospectively reviewed at an average follow-up of 10.5 years (range, 7 to 14 years). All surgeries were performed by one single surgeon. All of them underwent primary ACL reconstruction with autogenous hamstring tendon grafts. Assessment included Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, Tegner activity level. Patients were also asked what kind of injury they sustained (either direct or indirect trauma), what kind of sport they were performing when they got injured, at what time they did return to sports and which sport they practised before and after surgery. Results Fourteen patients underwent re-rupture. In 11 cases, this was due to a new trauma occurring at an average time of 22.9 (SD 23.8) months following primary surgery. In 3 cases rupture occurred during rehabilitation period. Mean postoperative KOOS score was 88.5 (SD 8.5), while mean IKDC subjective score was 87.5 (SD 10.9). At the time of follow-up, most patients (214 subjects, 98%) were participating in sport. 156 subjects returned to pre-injury level (71.6%). Conclusions The study reported long-term favourable subjective outcomes in amateur sportsman following ACL reconstruction, with a low re-rupture rate and a high percentage of subjects (93.6%) returning to sports participation 12 months after surgery. Most patients (71.6%) were able to return to their preprimary level of activity and sport. Younger age at the time of ACL reconstruction positively affected return to sports; however, younger patients were significantly more likely than older patients to undergo re-rupture.

TI  - T1ρ mapping of articular cartilage grafts after autologous osteochondral transplantation for osteochondral lesions of the talus: A longitudinal evaluation
PY  - 2018
AB  - BACKGROUND Clinical results of autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOT) for treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus have been mixed. T1ρ imaging can be used to noninvasively detect early cartilage degeneration. PURPOSE OR HYPOTHESIS To quantitatively assess, by means of T1ρ imaging, changes over time in the biochemical health of grafted cartilage after AOT for osteochondral lesions of the talus. STUDY TYPE Retrosepctive case series. POPULATION The study group comprised nine patients who underwent AOT for an osteochondral lesion of the talus and in whom T1ρ mapping was performed 1 and 2 years postoperatively. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE 3 Tesla. T1ρ-weighted turbo field echo. ASSESSMENT The mean T1ρ value of full-thickness cartilage at the repair site and that of full-thickness cartilage elsewhere in the same image (far-field cartilage) were determined. Clinical assessment was based on the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale. Correlation between the T1ρ ratios (grafted-to-far-field cartilage T1ρ values) and clinical outcomes was examined. STATISTICAL TESTS Mixed effects model. Pearson correlation analysis. RESULTS At 1 year, a significant difference existed between the mean T1ρ value of the grafted cartilage (57.0 ± 7.7 ms) and that of the far-field cartilage (41.8 ± 4.6 ms) (P < 0.001). At 2 years, the mean T1ρ value of the grafted cartilage (49.1 ± 6.4 ms) was significantly lower than that at 1 year (P = 0.011). Moderate negative correlation was found between the 1-year T1ρ ratio and 1-year AOFAS score (r = -0.60) and between the 2-year T1ρ ratio and 2-year AOFAS score (r = -0.50). DATA CONCLUSION Our observation of substantial restoration of the proteoglycan content of the grafted cartilage approximately 2 years after AOT for osteochondral lesions of the talus indicates that the content changes gradually and that the cartilage reparation process is slower than previously believed.

TI  - Two-Year Follow-up Study on Clinical and Radiological Outcomes of Polyurethane Meniscal Scaffolds
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background:Little is known about radial displacement (RD) of polyurethane (PU) scaffolds, intended for partial meniscus defect substitution; no data are available on whether rim thickness influences RD and whether RD correlates with clinical outcome scores.Hypotheses:The meniscus is not extruded preoperatively, but RD occurs after scaffold implantation. A thicker rim will limit RD, and there is no correlation between RD and clinical outcome.Study Design:Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Methods:Twenty-six patients were implanted with a PU scaffold (8 lateral, 18 medial). Radial displacement (mm) was evaluated on magnetic resonance images preoperatively and at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. At each time point, it was determined whether a correlation existed between the rim and RD.

TI  - Remnant-Tensioning Single-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Provides Comparable Stability to and Better Graft Vascularity Than Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Acute or Subacute Injury: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Study Using Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose To compare the clinical, second-look arthroscopic, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) findings between remnant-tensioning single-bundle (RT-SB) and double-bundle (DB) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Methods Sixty-seven patients with acute or subacute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury were randomized to undergo RT-SB or DB ACLR. Twenty-six patients in the RT-SB group and 28 in the DB group were evaluated using stability tests (Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer) and multiple clinical scores. One year postoperatively, all 54 patients underwent MRI for evaluation of graft continuity and graft signal/noise quotient and DCE-MRI for the calculation of normalized area under the curve (nAUC) as a marker of graft vascularity. Among them, 41 patients underwent second-look arthroscopy for the evaluation of graft continuity, graft tension, and synovialization. The results were compared between the 2 groups. Results At the minimum 2-year follow-up (28.7 ± 6.4 months), the stability tests, clinical scores, second-look arthroscopic findings, and MRI findings were not significantly different between the groups. However, the mean nAUC values on DCE-MRI for the ACL graft were significantly higher in the RT-SB group than those in the DB group in all 3 zones (nAUCproximal, P = .005; nAUCmiddle, P = .021; nAUCdistal, P = .027; and nAUCaverage, P = .008). Conclusion For acute or subacute ACL injury, the RT-SB ACLR showed an outcome comparable to that of DB ACLR in terms of knee stability, clinical scores, MRI findings, and second-look arthroscopic findings. Moreover, RT-SB ACLR showed better graft vascularity 1 year postoperatively than DB ACLR using DCE-MRI. Level of Evidence II, prospective randomized controlled trial

TI  - Safety and feasibility of using calcium phosphate hybridization method for quadriceps tendon-bone graft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Background To improve tendon-to-bone healing in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, a novel technique via the calcium phosphate (CaP) hybridization method for tendon graft using an alternate soaking process was developed. The use of the CaP hybridization method for quadriceps tendon-bone (QTB) graft in ACL reconstruction has not been reported in previous studies. Thus, this clinical trial aimed to clarify the safety and feasibility of using CaP hybridization method for quadriceps tendon-bone (QTB) graft in ACL reconstruction. Methods Eight patients (average age, 41.6 ± 10.6 years; 2 men and 6 women) with unilateral ACL injury were included in this study. They underwent ACL reconstruction using QTB graft that hybridized CaP. The follow-up period was from 2 months to 4 years (average, 2.4 ± 1.5 years). Cases of adverse events, including tumor formation, infection, fracture, contracture, severe pain, and re-rupture, were recorded. Moreover, clinical results (KT-1000 arthrometry, pivot-shift test, International Knee Documentation Committee grade, Lysholm scale, and sports activity level), and images of graft and bone tunnel (magnetic resonance imaging, arthroscopic appearance, and computed tomography) were also evaluated. Results No adverse events were observed in the follow-up periods. Postoperative clinical results showed improvement compared with the preoperative findings. The sports activity level after the surgery became equivalent to that before injury. There was no progression of bone tunnel enlargement. Conclusions Using the CaP hybridization method for QTB graft in ACL reconstruction was safe and feasible in the clinical trial. Moreover, this method may improve clinical outcomes. In the future, it is necessary to verify the effect of the CaP hybridization method for QTB graft in ACL reconstruction.

TI  - High-Grade Pivot Injuries and Quantitative Evaluation of Degree of Instability
PY  - 2021
AB  - The pivot-shift is the most specific clinical test to assess pathological knee joint rotatory laxity following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. This chapter attempts to describe the anatomic structures responsible for creating a high-grade pivot-shift and their potential role in customizing ACL reconstruction. A review of the literature demonstrates that disruption of the secondary stabilizers of anterior translation of the lateral compartment including the lateral meniscus, anterolateral capsule, and ilio-tibial band (ITB) contributes to a high-grade pivot-shift in the ACL-deficient knee joint. Additionally, the morphology of the lateral tibial plateau, including increased posterior tibial slope (PTS), can also contribute to high-grade pivot-shift.

TI  - Lésions isolées du ménisque latéral sur genou stable opérées : étude fonctionnelle à 10 ans de suivi Lateral meniscus injuries in knees without associated damage: 10 years follow-up study
PY  - 2012
AB  - Meniscals lesions are frequent during sport practice. Although lateral meniscus is affected in only 25% of all meniscus lesions, lateral lesions are usually known to have a poor clinical outcome. Our monocentric study consisted in a systematic evaluation of all patients treated in our unit for a unique lesion of the lateral meniscus in an otherwise normal knee. Follow-up was at least of ten years. Functional results were rated with four cotations currently used in traumatologic practice. A statistic analysis was made to identify predictive factors of poor outcome. Thirty-nine patients have been included. Functional evaluation showed 12% of excellent, 41% of good, 35% of medium and 12% of bad results with Arpege score, 65% of good and very good and 35% of medium results with Lysholm score. The average subjective IKDC score was 58 ± 15, objective IKDC cotation found 0% of A, 88% of B and 12% of C. The average Koos score was 83.7 ± 17. Better evolution was found for patients with horizontal lesions (P = 0.04) or patients with central segment injury (P = 0.05). Similar data concerning the poor functional outcome of lateral meniscus tears has been published. Only two thirds of patients have good or excellent results after 10 years. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Autograft Versus Allograft in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials and Systematic Review of Overlapping Systematic Reviews
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose To compare autograft with allograft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by conducting a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and a systematic review of overlapping systematic reviews. Methods PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through June 28, 2014, to identify Level I and II evidence RCTs with a minimum follow-up of 2 years and systematic reviews that compared autograft with allograft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Both objective and subjective outcomes with respect to knee stability and function were meta-analyzed and summarized. The overall risk ratio (RR) or the weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated using either a fixed- or random-effects model. The quality of evidence of the systematic review of overlapping systematic reviews was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. Results Nine RCTs and 10 systematic reviews were included. In general, statistically significant differences in favor of autograft were observed for clinical failure (RR, 0.47; P  = .0007), the Lachman test (RR, 1.18; P  = .03), the instrumented laxity test (WMD, −0.88; P  = .004), and the Tegner score (WMD, 0.36; P  = .004). When subgroup analyses were conducted based on whether irradiation was used, autograft achieved better clinical outcomes than irradiated allograft in terms of the Lysholm score, clinical failure, the pivot-shift test, the Lachman test, the instrumented laxity test, and the Tegner score. In addition, there were no significant differences between the autograft and nonirradiated allograft groups for all 8 indices. The final results of this systematic review of overlapping systematic reviews were in accordance with our meta-analysis. Conclusions Autograft had greater advantages than irradiated allograft with respect to function and stability, whereas there were no significant differences between autograft and nonirradiated allograft. Level of Evidence Level IV, meta-analysis of Level II, III, and IV studies.

TI  - Knee joint unloading and daily physical activity associate with cartilage T2 relaxation times 1 month after ACL injury.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is prevalent after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, but mechanismsunderlying its development are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine if gait biomechanics and daily physical activity (PA) associate with cartilage T2 relaxation times, a marker of collagen organization and water content, 1 month after ACL injury. Twenty-seven participants (15-35 years old) without chondral lesions completed magnetic resonance imaging, three-dimensional gait analysis, and 1 week of PA accelerometry. Interlimb differences and ratios were calculated for gait biomechanics and T2 relaxation times, respectively. Multiple linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, and concomitant meniscus injury were used to determine the association between gait biomechanics and PA with T2 relaxation times, respectively. Altered knee adduction moment (KAM) impulse, less knee flexion excursion (kEXC) and higher daily step counts accounted for 35.8%-65.8% of T2 relaxation time variation in the weightbearing and posterior cartilage of the medial and lateral compartment (all p ≤ .011). KAM impulse was the strongest factor for T2 relaxation times in all models (all p ≤ .001). Lower KAM impulse associated with longer T2 relaxation times in the injured medial compartment (β = -.720 to -.901) and shorter T2 relaxation in the lateral compartment (β = .713 to .956). At 1 month after ACL injury, altered KAM impulse, less kEXC, and higher PA associated with longer T2 relaxation times, which may indicate poorer cartilage health. Statement of Clinical Significance: Gait biomechanics and daily PA are modifiable targets that may improve cartilage health acutely after ACL injury and slow progression to OA.

TI  - Derotational Distal Femoral Osteotomy Yields Better Outcomes in Patellar Dislocation With Supracondylar Femoral Torsion Compared With Distal Femoral Torsion: A Retrospective Comparative Study
PY  - 2024
AB  - <title>Abstract</title><p><bold>Background:</bold>Controversy exists regarding the origin of femoral torsion, and specific treatment rules regarding the optimal position of femoral osteotomy in patients with recurrent patellar dislocation (RPD) and excessive femoral torsion are scarce.<bold>Purpose:</bold>To establish a novel classification system for such patients, and to compare clinical and radiological outcomes after derotational distal femoral osteotomy (DDFO) between femoral torsion at supracondylar (neck and shaft) and distal levels.<bold>Methods:</bold>Between January 2014 and June 2019, patients who underwent DDFO were retrospectively reviewed. The segmental torsion analysis was performed to establish a novel classification system, and classify included patients into two groups: 35 patients in supracondylar torsion group and 38 patients in distal torsion group. These patients were followed-up for at least 3 years. Clinical evaluations included functional outcomes, physical examinations, quality of life, activity level, satisfaction, and complications. Radiological outcomes included patellofemoral osteoarthritis, congruence, and alignment.<bold>Results:</bold>Type I was defined as the supracondylar torsion. Type II was defined as the distal torsion. Supracondylar torsion group had lower postoperative femoral torsion (12.6 ± 2.6° vs 14.8 ± 3.6°;<italic>P</italic>= .004) and higher surgical correction angle (21.6 ± 5.0° vs 19.1 ± 3.0°;<italic>P</italic>= .009). All clinical and radiological outcomes improved significantly in both groups, but supracondylar torsion group had significantly higher quality of life (EQ-5D-5L: 0.96 ± 0.06 vs 0.91 ± 0.07;<italic>P</italic>= .003. EQ-VAS: 92.0 ± 6.0 vs 88.7 ± 5.8;<italic>P</italic>= .021) and Tegner activity score (5.2 ± 1.5 vs 4.5 ± 1.4;<italic>P</italic>= .040), and fewer patellofemoral osteoarthritis (8.6% vs 26.3%;<italic>P</italic>= .048). Two patients in the distal torsion group had subjective patellar instability. The percentage of patients with anterior knee pain was higher in the distal torsion group.<bold>Conclusion:</bold>A novel classification system for patients with RPD and excessive femoral torsion based on segmental femoral torsion analysis was established. DDFO was more appropriate for patients with supracondylar torsion, yielding higher surgical correction angle, and better clinical and radiological outcomes.<bold>Study Design:</bold>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>

TI  - Association Between Anterior Tibial Subluxation of Lateral Compartment and High-Grade Knee Laxity in Patients With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Deficiency.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">High-grade knee laxity and excessive anterior tibial subluxation (ATS) are correlated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency and share similar risk factors; however, the association between excessive ATS and high-grade knee laxity remains unclear.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">To identify the association between excessive ATS and high-grade knee laxity in patients with ACL deficiency and determine the possibility that ATS can predict high-grade knee laxity.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN">Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">A total of 226 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between May 2018 and March 2022 were analyzed in the present study; the high-grade group consisted of 113 patients who had a grade 3 result on the preoperative anterior drawer test, Lachman test, or pivot-shift test while under anesthesia, and the low-grade group consisted of 113 matched patients. The ATS values for medial and lateral compartments (ATSMC and ATSLC) were measured on magnetic resonance imaging while patients relaxed the quadriceps in the supine position under no anesthesia. The optimal cutoff values of ATSMC and ATSLC for high-grade knee laxity were determined using receiver operating characteristic curves. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with stratification were performed to identify the association between excessive ATS and high-grade knee laxity.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Compared with the low-grade group, the high-grade group had a longer time from injury to surgery; higher rates of medial meniscus posterior horn tear (MMPHT), lateral meniscus posterior horn tear (LMPHT), and anterolateral ligament (ALL) abnormality; and larger lateral tibial slope, ATSMC, and ATSLC. The optimal cutoff value was 2.6 mm (sensitivity, 52.2%; specificity, 76.1%) for ATSMC and 4.5 mm (sensitivity, 67.3%; specificity, 64.6%) for ATSLC in predicting high-grade knee laxity. After adjustment for covariates, ATSLC ≥4.5 mm (odds ratio [OR], 2.94; 95% CI, 1.56-5.55; <i>P</i> = .001), MMPHT (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.35-5.08; <i>P</i> = .004), LMPHT (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.20-4.78; <i>P</i> = .014), and ALL abnormality (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.13-3.89; <i>P</i> = .019) were associated with high-grade knee laxity. The association between excessive ATSLC and high-grade knee laxity was validated in patients with acute ACL injury as well as those with chronic ACL injury.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">Excessive ATSLC was associated with high-grade knee laxity in patients who had ACL deficiency, with a predictive cutoff value of 4.5 mm. This study may help surgeons estimate the degree of knee instability more accurately before anesthesia and may facilitate preliminary surgical decision-making, such as appropriate graft choices and consideration of extra-articular augmentation.</AbstractText>

TI  - Reliability and usefulness of a new in vivo measurement system of the pivot shift.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Residual pivot shift after ACL reconstruction is a crucial factor related to poor clinical outcome. However, no method exists that is able to evaluate pivot shift quantitatively and noninvasively. We propose a new measurement system for the pivot shift test using an electromagnetic device and have evaluated its reliability and clinical usefulness. Posterior translation, lateral translation and maximum velocity during the reduction phase of pivot shift were calculated and used as parameters for evaluation. In measurement system analysis, discrepancies of motion between the bones and the sensors were minimal, while reproducibility in repeated measurement was acceptable. Next, clinical usefulness was evaluated by correlating the values obtained by kinematic measurement with the clinical grade. We found differences in each of the measured parameters among clinical grades. These data suggest the system is a valuable measurement tool for clinical evaluation of the pivot shift test.

TI  - Movement of the knee in osteoarthritis : The use of electrogoniometry to assess function
PY  - 2001
AB  - We used electrogoniometers to measure the range of movement (ROM) of the knee during various activities, comparing 50 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee (OA) with 20 healthy age- and sex-matched subjects. The minimum and maximum joint angles and the ranges of excursion of the patient and control groups were tested for significant differences, using an unrelated Student's t-test with pooled variance. Knee flexion in patients with OA was significantly reduced during all activities (p < 0.05), but differences in knee extension were not significant except when patients negotiated stairs. We believe that this reduction in ROM is caused by inhibition due to pain when load-bearing. Static non-load-bearing measurements of the ROM poorly reflected the functional ROM, with a coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.59 in the patient group and 0.60 in the control group. Electrogoniometry of the ROM of the knee provides a reliable, accurate and objective measurement of knee function.

TI  - Posterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Patients with Generalized Joint Laxity
PY  - 2008
AB  - Generalized joint laxity has been considered a risk factor causing late failure of reconstructed anterior cruciate ligaments, although it is unknown whether that is the case for reconstructed posterior cruciate ligaments. We hypothesized patients with generalized joint laxity, compared with those without laxity, would have similar postoperative knee stability, range of motion, and functional scores after posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The Beighton and Horan criteria were used to determine generalized joint laxity. We enrolled 24 patients with generalized joint laxity (Group L) and 29 patients without any positive findings of joint laxity (Group N) matched by gender and age. The average side-by-side differences of posterior tibial translation were 4.72 mm in Group L and 3.63 mm in Group N. We observed no differences in posterior tibial translation with differing graft materials or combined procedures. In Group L the International Knee Documentation Committee score was normal in 12.5% and nearly normal in 45.8% whereas in Group N, 24.1% were normal and 55.2% nearly normal. Patients with generalized joint laxity showed more posterior laxity than patients without joint laxity. Generalized joint laxity therefore appears to be a risk factor associated with posterior laxity after posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Level of Evidence: Level III, prognostic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Výsledky léčby niktrokloubních zlomenin proximální tibie v ÚN Brno v letech 1997 až 1999: hodnocení po 5-7 letech od terapie Treatment of Intra-Articular Proximal Tibial Evaluation of Two- to Seven-Year Follow-up
PY  - 2007
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Intra-articular fractures of the proximal tibia always present a complicated therapeutic problem. In this retrospective study, the results of both conservative and surgical treatment of these fractures are evaluated. MATERIAL In the period from 1997 to 1999, 114 patients with proximal tibial fractures were treated in the Traumatological Hospital in Brno-Traumacenter. Of these, 34 (30 %) were treated conservatively and 80 (70 %) by a surgical procedure. A total of 80 patients were included in follow-up (70 %). Of these, 61 had surgery, which involved arthroscopically-assisted intervention in 25 patients, arthrotomy in 27 patients and open reduction with external fixation in nine patients who had an open fracture (eight had type C3 fracture). Minimally invasive fixation with a cancellous screw and washer was used in 25, and ab uttress plate in 27 patients. Spongioplasty was carried out in 11 patients. METHODS Clinical and questionnaire-based evaluation was undertaken at 5 to 7 years after the injury and following therapy. The outcome was assessed on the basis of two classification systems, i.e., the IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) score and the Lansinger score designed particularly for the evaluation of proximal tibial fractures. The outcomes were evaluated in relation to fracture type, conservative or surgical treatment, method of osteosynthesis, and use of arthroscopic control and spongioplasty. RESULTS In each of the evaluated patients, radiographs were obtained after injury and then at the completion of therapy. The fractures classified according to the AO system were as follows: type A1 fractures – 9 patients; types B1, B2, B3 – 46 patients; types C1, C2, C3 – 34 patients. The average IKDC and the Lansinger scores achieved at 5- to 7-year follow-up were 70 and 24 points, respectively. This can be regarded as a very good result. Within 5 years of injury, four patients underwent total knee arthroplasty; all of them were over 50 years and had a type C3 fracture. The type B3 and C3 treated by arthrotomy showed similar outcomes on both classification systems (IKDC/Lansinger: 69/67 and 24/24, respectively). The B3 fractures operated on under arthroscopic control had better outcomes (77/69) than those treated by arthrotomy (27/25), because this approach combines advantages of inner fracture fixation with a minimally invasive surgical technique. Better results were also achieved in fractures treated by minimally invasive fixation with cancellous screws. DISCUSSION The outcomes of therapy in intra-articular fractures of the proximal tibia related to how serious the fracture was and how well it was reduced and stabilized. Both the approach to fracture reduction and the method of its stabilization (buttress plate, minimally invasive screws, external fixator) are selected according to fracture type and soft tissue state. Spongioplasty is indicated if subchondral bone is affected. Reduction and stabilization performed under arthroscopic control permit more precise reconstruction of the articular surface, but can be used only for certain fractures (type A1 and B1, B2 and B3). For reduction and stabilization of all fracture types, with the exception of AO type 41A-1 fracture, an Y-ray image intensifier system is necessary. The meniscus above the injured bone should be preserved in order to maintain good function of the joint. CONCLUSIONS In intra-articular fractures of the proximal tibia, treatment outcomes depend on the type of fracture as well as correct reduction and use of appropriate fixation. When accurate alignment, joint stability and well reduced articular surfaces are achieved, outcomes are very good. At mid-term follow-up, reduction under arthroscopic control gives better results than stabilization performed by arthrotomy.

TI  - Is It Necessary to Repair Stable Ramp Lesions of the Medial Meniscus During Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction? A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial:
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background:A special type of meniscal lesion involving the peripheral attachment of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus (PHMM), termed a “ramp lesion,” is commonly associated with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, its treatment is still controversial. Recently, stable ramp lesions treated with abrasion and trephination alone have been shown to have good clinical outcomes after ACL reconstruction.Hypothesis:Stable ramp lesions treated with abrasion and trephination alone during ACL reconstruction will result in similar clinical outcomes compared with those treated with surgical repair.Study Design:Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.Methods:A prospective randomized controlled study was performed in 91 consecutive patients who had complete ACL injuries and concomitant stable ramp lesions of the medial meniscus. All patients were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups based on whether the stable ramp lesions were surgically repaired (study group; n = 50) or only abraded an...

TI  - Cicatrisation sur tuteur synthétique dans les ruptures récentes du ligament croisé postérieur
PY  - 2005
AB  - Resume Le but de cette etude etait d’analyser les resultats de la reconstruction avec adjonction d’un ligament synthetique dans les grandes laxites fraiches isolees ou combinees du ligament croise posterieur (LCP) (triades, pentades ou luxations). Notre hypothese etait que le ligament synthetique servait de tuteur a la cicatrisation dirigee du ligament rompu. La reconstruction du LCP a ete realisee a l’aide d’un ligament synthetique chez 14 patients consecutifs : 3 ruptures isolees du LCP (laxite > 15 mm), 6 laxites combinees (mediale ou laterale) et 5 luxations. La laxite posterieure moyenne etait de 24 mm. L’intervention a ete realisee entre le 7 e et le 53 e jour, 6 fois par arthroscopie, 8 fois par arthrotomie. Le ligament synthetique etait un ligament polyester (Lars ® ) de diametre 6 ou 8 mm a 1 ou 2 faisceaux. Toutes les lesions associees ont ete en reparees dans le meme temps sauf dans 2 cas. Le recul moyen est de 36 mois (10-88 mois). Tous les patients ont ete revus a l’exception d’un patient contacte par questionnaire. Les genoux ont ete evalues selon le score IKDC et la laxite mesuree par Telos. Cinq raideurs du genou ont necessite une mobilisation ou une arthrolyse arthroscopique. Une rupture secondaire objectivee en arthroscopie est survenue a distance a l’occasion d’un nouveau traumatisme. Subjectivement, 2 patients etaient tres satisfaits, 8 satisfaits, 4 decus. Les mobilites finales etaient : 6/0/130. Un tiroir posterieur clinique direct etait present dans 12 cas : la differentielle au Telos etait mesure a 8 mm. Le score IKDC global etait : A : 0 ; B : 7 ; C : 3 ; D : 2. La persistance d’une laxite posterieure etait l’element pejoratif du score. Les resultats etaient moins bons sur tous les items pour les laxites postero-laterales. Il n’y avait pas de difference entre 1 ou 2 faisceaux. Nous n’avons pas observe de morbidite propre au ligament synthetique (synovite, rupture spontanee). Le gain sur la laxite posterieure est tres important. Les resultats dependent des lesions associees en particulier laterales (raideur, score IKDC) plus que de la technique de reparation du LCP. Le ligament synthetique semble bien avoir joue son role de tuteur : 1 faisceau unique et de diametre 6 mm est suffisant. Cette technique qui epargne le capital tendineux, nous parait pouvoir etre proposee dans les grandes laxites du LCP. Un suivi a plus long terme est necessaire pour confirmer la stabilisation durable de la laxite.

TI  - Results of Chondrocyte Implantation with a Fibrin-Hyaluronan Matrix: A Preliminary Study
PY  - 2008
AB  - Fibrin, a homologous polymer, is the natural scaffold of wound healing and therefore a candidate as a carrier for cell transplantation. We explored a novel matrix-based implant cartilage repair composed of both fibrin and hyaluronan in a defined ratio that takes advantage of the biological and mechanical properties of these two elements. The matrix was seeded with autologous chondrocytes expanded in the presence of a proprietary growth factor variant designed to preserve their chondrogenic potential. We prospectively followed eight patients with symptomatic-chronic cartilage defects treated with this carrier. Patients had arthroscopy to harvest autologous chondrocytes then grown in autologous serum. Chondrocytes were cultured in the presence of the FGF variant and then seeded on the fibrin-hyaluronan matrix. About 4 weeks following biopsy, the patients underwent implantation of the constructs by miniarthrotomy. Three of the eight patients had transient effusion. Clinical performance was measured by Lysholm and IKDC scores, MRI, and the need for secondary surgery. The clinical outcome of a 1-year followup demonstrated increase of clinical scores. The MRI followup showed good filling of the defect with tissue having the imaging appearance of cartilage in all patients. Apart from the transient effusion in three patients we observed no other adverse events during the followup.

TI  - Five-Strand Versus Four-Strand Hamstring Autografts in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction-A Prospective Randomized Controlled Study.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose To compare the clinical outcomes of the routine use of 5-strand hamstring grafts (where possible) with those of 4-strand grafts in primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods A total of 64 patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled study comparing the use of 5-strand and 4-strand semitendinosus–gracilis autografts in single bundle ACL reconstruction (n = 32 in each group). Four participants in each group were lost to follow-up and were excluded from the outcome analysis. The outcomes of 28 patients in the 5-strand group and 28 patients in the 4-strand group were analyzed. The diameters of all grafts were measured intraoperatively. Patients were assessed postoperatively at 2 years with objective assessments (anterior knee laxity using the KT-2000 arthrometer, Lachman test, pivot-shift test, hop test) and patient-reported outcome scores (Lysholm knee score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee score, SF-36 physical and mental components, Tegner activity scale). Postoperative graft ruptures were also noted. Results There were improvements in all outcome measures postoperatively regardless of the number of graft strands. When we compared the study and control groups, there were no significant differences in all subjective and objective outcome measures except the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score symptoms score (5-strand group 93.3 ± 9.2 vs 4-strand group 86.2 ± 14.7, P = .04). The KT-2000 side-to-side difference was 2.79 ± 2.11 mm in the 5-strand group and 2.54 ± 1.75 mm in the 4-strand group (P = .63). The 5-strand study group had 2 graft ruptures at 1 year, whereas the 4-strand control group had one partial graft rupture at 6 months. Conclusions At 2-year follow-up, the routine use of the 5-strand hamstring tendon autograft was not superior to that of the quadrupled or 4-strand graft in primary ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Short-Term Outcomes of Concomitant Patellofemoral Arthroplasty and Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction to Treat Concurrent Patellofemoral Arthritis and Patellar Instability.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of combined patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) and medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction in patients with patellofemoral arthritis in the setting of concomitant patellar instability. Patients who underwent single-stage, combined PFA and MPFL reconstruction by a single surgeon at a tertiary-care orthopaedic center between 2016 and 2021 were identified. Postoperative radiographic and clinical outcomes at a minimum of 6 months were recorded using patient-reported outcome measures, including International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Kujala, and VR-12. Early complications and rates of recurrent instability were also recorded. Of the 16 patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 patients were available for final follow-up (81%; 51.7 ± 7.2 years, 11 females, 2 males) with a mean clinical follow-up of 1.3 ± 0.5 years (range: 0.5-2.3 years). Patients experienced significant improvements in patellar tilt and multiple patient-reported outcome metrics postoperatively, including IKDC, Kujala, VR-12 Mental Health, and VR-12 Physical Health. At the time of the most recent follow-up, no patient had experienced a postoperative dislocation or subluxation event. The findings suggest that concurrent PFA and MPFL reconstruction are associated with significant improvements in multiple patient-reported outcomes. Further studies are needed to evaluate the duration of clinical benefits achieved with this combined intervention.

TI  - The clinical, radiographic, histological and ultrastructural results after Anterior Cruciate Ligament reconstruction using autografts
PY  - 2007
AB  - The principal aims of the study were to perform a long-term analysis of the patellar tendon structure after harvesting its central third as an autograft during ACL reconstruction. The patellar tendon underwent long-term serial morphological evaluations using MRI, histological evaluations at two and six years and ultrastructural evaluation six years after the harvesting procedure. Furthermore, the results after ACL reconstruction using BPTB or ST/G autografts were compared in a prospective study in a group of exclusively female patients. All the patients underwent a standardised rehabilitation programme involving full range of motion exercises and full weight-bearing immediately after the reconstruction. Nineteen patients underwent serial MRI examinations of the donor site six weeks, six months, two years and six years after the harvesting procedure. The study revealed that the patellar tendon had not normalised morphologically, compared with the contralateral side, up to six years after the harvesting procedure. Seventeen patients underwent an ultrasonography-guided biopsy procedure of the central and lateral parts of the patellar tendon at the donor site, two and six years after the harvesting procedure. On both occasions, an increase in cellularity and vascularity and deterioration in fibre structure were found in the biopsy specimens from both the central and lateral parts of the patellar tendon at the donor site compared with normal control tendons. Biopsy specimens from 13 patients obtained at six years were also evaluated using transmission electron microscopy. The extracellular matrix was more heterogeneous in the specimens from both the central and lateral parts of the patellar tendon, compared with normal control tendon. Moreover, significantly more small fibrils were found in both the central and lateral parts of the patellar tendon, compared with normal control tendons. In a prospective study involving 63 female patients, donor-site morbidity in the form of kneewalking problems was significantly more common after using the BPTB autograft than after using the ST/G autograft. In terms of knee laxity and functional outcome, no significant differences were registered. To summarise, the patellar tendon does not appear to regain normal morphology, histology and ultrastructure, up to six years after harvesting its central third. It appears that there is a longstanding effect on the entire tendon and not just the central part from where the graft was initially harvested.

TI  - Septic arthritis after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a retrospective analysis of incidence, management and outcome
PY  - 2007
AB  - BackgroundSeptic arthritis after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a rare complication. In the literature, several different managements are proposed.HypothesisThe graft can be retained during treatment of a septic arthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.Study DesignCase series; Level of evidence, 4.MethodsA retrospective analysis of knee joint infections occurring after arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions was conducted. Fifteen patients were treated for postoperative septic arthritis of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction between 1996 and 2005. All patients underwent an urgent extensive arthroscopic debridement (washout and synovectomy) and parenteral antibiotics and oral antibiotics subsequently. Repetitive wash-outs were performed if necessary. The average time at follow-up for our series was 58 months (range, 9-99 months).ResultsOnly 1 graft was removed during debridement because it was nonfunctional. All o...

TI  - Knee Osteochondritis Dissecans Treated by the AO Hook Fixation System: A Four Year Follow-Up of an Alternative Technique.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Surgical fixation is recommended for stable osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) lesions that have failed nonoperative management and for all unstable lesions. In this study we set out to describe and evaluate an alternative method of surgical fixation for such lesions. Five knees with unstable OCD lesions in four male adolescent patients with open physes were treated with the AO Hook Fixation System. The outcome was evaluated both clinically and with three separate outcome systems (IKDC 2000, KOOS, Lysholm) at one and a mean four year follow-up. We demonstrated excellent clinical results in all patients. At four years, all scoring systems demonstrated statistically significant improvement when compared to the preoperative status. Our study suggests that the AO Hook Fixation System is an alternative method of surgical intervention with comparable medium term results with other existing modes of fixation and the added biomechanical advantage of the absence of distracting forces during hardware removal.

TI  - Outcome of Patellar Tendon Versus 4-Strand Hamstring Tendon Autografts for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Prospective Randomized Trials
PY  - 2016
AB  - Purpose To compare clinical outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and investigate whether the clinical results of 4-strand hamstring tendon (HT) reconstruction are still inferior to that of the patellar tendon (PT). Methods We performed a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the English literature on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane register for papers that compared clinical outcomes of PT versus HT for ACL reconstruction. Outcome measures analyzed included rate of rerupture, KT-1000, International Knee Documentation Committee grade, Lachman, pivot shift, Lysholm score, Tegner Activity Scale, anterior knee pain, and discomfort on kneeling. Results We included 19 studies from an initial 1,168 abstracts for the systematic review, and, eventually, 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The study population consisted of a total of 1784 patients. The average follow-up duration was 58.8 months. We found significant differences in favor of the HT technique in the domains of anterior knee pain, kneeling pain, and restriction in the range of active extension ("extension deficit"). We found no differences between the PT and HT technique in terms of rerupture rate. There were no clinically significant differences for the outcomes of Lysholm score and Tegner Activity Scale as well as the KT-1000 side-to-side at maximum manual force. Conclusions Contemporary 4-strand HT ACL reconstruction is comparable with the PT technique in terms of clinical stability and postoperative functional status across most parameters studied. The HT technique carries lower risk of postoperative complications such as anterior knee pain, kneeling discomfort, and extension deficit. Primary ACL reconstruction using the 4-strand HT technique achieves clinical results that are comparable with the PT technique with significantly less postoperative complications. Level of Evidence Level I, systemic review and meta-analysis of Level I studies.

TI  - The Cochrane Library - Computer assisted surgery for knee ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2014
AB  - BACKGROUND Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is one of the most frequently performed orthopaedic procedures. The most common technical cause of reconstruction failure is graft malpositioning. Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) aims to improve the accuracy of graft placement. Although posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury and reconstruction are far less common, PCL reconstruction has comparable difficulties relating to graft placement. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2011. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of computer-assisted reconstruction surgery versus conventional operating techniques for ACL or PCL injuries in adults. SEARCH METHODS For this update, we searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (from 2010 to July 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 5, 2013), MEDLINE (from 2010 to July 2013), EMBASE (from 2010 to July 2013), CINAHL (from 2010 to July 2013), article references and prospective trial registers. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared CAS for ACL or PCL reconstruction versus conventional operating techniques not involving CAS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently screened search results, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and extracted data. Where appropriate, we pooled data using risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS The updated search resulted in the inclusion of one new study. This review now includes five RCTs with 366 participants. There were more female than male participants (70% were female); their ages ranged from 14 to 53 years. All trials involved ACL reconstructions performed by experienced surgeons.Assessing the studies' risk of bias was hampered by poor reporting of trial methods, and consequently several studies were judged to be 'unclear' for several types of bias. One trial presenting primary outcome data was at high risk of detection bias from lack of clinician blinding and attrition bias from an unaccounted loss to follow-up at two years.We found moderate quality evidence (three trials, 193 participants) of no clinically relevant difference between CAS and conventional surgery in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores (self-reported measure of knee function; scale of 0 to 100 where 100 was best function). Pooled data from two of these trials (120 participants) showed a small, but clinically irrelevant difference favouring CAS (MD 2.05, 95% CI -2.16 to 6.25). A third trial (73 participants) also found minimal difference in IKDC subjective scores (reported MD 0.2).We found low quality evidence (two trials, 120 participants) showing no difference between the two groups in Lysholm scores, also measured on a scale 0 to 100 where 100 is best function (MD 0.25, 95% CI -3.75 to 4.25). We found very low quality evidence (one trial, 40 participants) showing no difference between the two groups in Tegner scores. We found low quality evidence (three trials, 173 participants) showing the majority of participants in both groups were assessed as having normal or nearly normal knee function (86/87 with CAS versus 84/86 with no CAS; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.06).Similarly, no differences were found for our secondary outcome measures of knee stability, loss in range of motion and tunnel placement. None of the trials reported on re-operation.No adverse post-surgical events were reported in two trials (133 participants); this outcome was not reported by the other three trials.CAS use was associated with longer operating times compared with conventional operating techniques: the mean difference in operating times reported in the studies ranged between 9 and 27 minutes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS From the available evidence, we are unable to demonstrate or refute a favourable effect of CAS for cruciate ligament reconstructions of the knee compared with conventional reconstructions. However, the currently available evidence does not indicate that CAS in knee ligament reconstruction improves outcome. There is a need for improved reporting of future studies of this technology.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Skeletally Immature Patients With Transphyseal Tunnels
PY  - 2012
AB  - Purpose Our purpose was to evaluate the results of transphyseal anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with hamstring autograft in skeletally immature patients. Methods Eighteen knees in 18 skeletally immature pubescent patients with a mean chronologic age of 14.2 years underwent transphyseal ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft between 2002 and 2007. Concurrent meniscal surgery was performed in 9 knees. The final patient evaluation occurred at a mean of 43.4 months (range, 24.0 to 86.6 months) and included physical examination, KT-1000 arthrometry testing (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and functional outcome instruments, including the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form, the Lysholm knee score, and the Tegner knee activity scale. Results At the latest follow-up, the mean International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee score was 92.4 ± 10, the mean Lysholm knee score was 94.3 ± 8.8, and the mean Tegner activity scale score was 8.5 ± 1.4. Lachman and pivot-shift testing were negative in all knees. No restriction in knee range of motion of 5° or greater when compared with the contralateral knee was observed in any patient. The mean manual maximum side-to-side difference with KT-1000 testing was 0.29 ± 1.07 mm, and no patients had a difference greater than 3 mm. No angular deformities were noted, and all leg-length measurements were symmetric bilaterally on clinical examination. No patients had traumatic graft disruption or underwent revision ACL reconstruction, whereas 3 patients sustained an ACL injury in the contralateral leg while participating in sports. Conclusions Transphyseal ACL reconstruction with autogenous quadrupled hamstring graft with metaphyseal fixation in skeletally immature pubescent patients yielded excellent functional outcomes in a high percentage of patients without perceived clinical growth disturbance. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Versus Hamstring Tendon: A Prospective Comparative Study With 9-Year Follow-Up
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose To analyze the long-term evaluation of clinical, functional, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results after implant-free press-fit anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with bone–patella tendon (BPT) versus quadrupled hamstring tendon (HT) grafts. Methods Sixty-two ACL-insufficient patients were included in a prospective, randomized study (31 BPT and 31 HT). Both surgical procedures were performed without any implants by a press-fit technique by the senior author. The femoral tunnel was drilled through the anteromedial portal for anatomic placement. At 8.8 years after reconstruction, 53 patients (28 BPT and 25 HT) were examined by different clinical and functional tests. Bilateral MRI scans were performed and interpreted by an independent radiologist. Results On follow-up, the score on the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form was significantly better in the HT group. The clinical examination including range of motion, KT-1000 test (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and pivot-shift test showed no significant differences. On isokinetic testing, the mean quadriceps strength was close to normal (96%) in both groups, but the hamstring strength was lower in the HT group (100.3%/95.1%). Kneeling (1.5/1.1, P = .002), knee walking (1.72/1.14, P = .002), and single-leg hop test (95.8%/99.1%, P = .057) were better in the HT group. The MRI findings about the mean degree of cartilage lesion (International Cartilage Repair Society protocol) of the operated (2.1/2.1) and nonoperated (1.4/1.8) knee showed no significant differences. No significant difference was found in the grade of medial or lateral meniscal lesion or the number of patients having meniscal lesions when the operated and nonoperated knees were compared. Tunnel measurements, Caton-Deschamps Index, and the sagittal ACL angle were similar. Conclusions The implant-free press-fit technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by use of bone–patellar tendon and hamstring grafts with anatomic graft placement is an innovative technique to preserve the cartilage and meniscal status without significant differences between the operated and nonoperated knees in the long term. Significantly less anterior knee pain was noted in the hamstring group, when testing for kneeling and knee walking. Level of Evidence Level II, prospective comparative study.

TI  - Self-reported Knee Function Can Identify Athletes Who Fail Return to Activity Criteria up to 1 Year after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction. A Delaware-Oslo ACL Cohort Study
PY  - 2014
AB  - Study Design Cohort study, cross-sectional. Objectives To determine if self-reported knee function assessed with the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 Subjective Knee Form (IKDC 2000) could discriminate between successful and nonsuccessful performance on return-to-activity criteria (RTAC) tests after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Background Selecting appropriate performance-based and patient-reported tests that can detect side-to-side asymmetries, assess global knee function, and determine a participant's readiness to return to activity after ACL reconstruction can be a challenge for rehabilitation specialists. A simple tool or questionnaire to identify athletes with neuromuscular impairments or activity limitations could provide rehabilitation specialists with crucial data pertinent to their patients' current knee function and readiness to return to higher-level activities.

TI  - Clinical outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament injury: panther symposium ACL injury clinical outcomes consensus group.
PY  - 2020
AB  - A stringent outcome assessment is a key aspect for establishing evidence-based clinical guidelines for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury treatment. The aim of this consensus statement was to establish what data should be reported when conducting an ACL outcome study, what specific outcome measurements should be used and at what follow-up time those outcomes should be assessed. To establish a standardized approach to assessment of clinical outcome after ACL treatment, a consensus meeting including a multidisciplinary group of ACL experts was held at the ACL Consensus Meeting Panther Symposium, Pittsburgh, PA; USA, in June 2019. The group reached consensus on nine statements by using a modified Delphi method. In general, outcomes after ACL treatment can be divided into four robust categories—early adverse events, patient-reported outcomes, ACL graft failure/recurrent ligament disruption and clinical measures of knee function and structure. A comprehensive assessment following ACL treatment should aim to provide a complete overview of the treatment result, optimally including the various aspects of outcome categories. For most research questions, a minimum follow-up of 2 years with an optimal follow-up rate of 80% is necessary to achieve a comprehensive assessment. This should include clinical examination, any sustained re-injuries, validated knee-specific PROs and Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaires. In the mid- to long-term follow-up, the presence of osteoarthritis should be evaluated. This consensus paper provides practical guidelines for how the aforementioned entities of outcomes should be reported and suggests the preferred tools for a reliable and valid assessment of outcome after ACL treatment.

TI  - Diameter of Quadrupled Semitendinosus Autograft in Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Did Not Impact Early Revision Rate or Functional Outcome in a Large Cohort of Patients.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To determine whether the diameter of the quadrupled semitendinosus tendon (ST) graft in primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is related to the risk of revision ACLR within 2 years of primary ACLR, postoperative knee laxity, and patient-reported knee outcome. Furthermore, to investigate whether smaller graft than estimated is related to revision ACLR.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Patients who underwent primary ACLR with a quadrupled ST autograft at our institution from January 2005 to December 2017 were identified. Data from the Swedish National Knee Ligament Registry were collected up to 2 years or until revision surgery was registered within 2 years after primary ACLR. Knee laxity was assessed preoperatively and at 6-month follow-up using the KT-1000 arthrometer (134 N anterior tibial load). The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was collected preoperatively and at 2 years postoperatively from Swedish National Knee Ligament Registry. On the basis of anthropometric measurements (body height and weight) and sex, the estimated quadrupled ST graft diameter was calculated.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 4,519 patients who underwent ACLR with a quadrupled ST autograft were included. The mean graft diameter was 8.3 ± 0.7 mm; 8.0 ± 0.6 mm for women and 8.6 ± 0.7 mm for men. The quadrupled ST graft diameter was not significantly correlated to revision ACLR. There was no significant difference in the ST graft diameter regarding postoperative knee laxity. The correlations between ST graft diameter and KOOS were weak, except for the "sport and recreation" subscale (P = .012).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The quadrupled ST graft diameter was not significantly related to the need for early revision ACLR, nor was it related to postoperative knee laxity or patient-reported outcome except for the KOOS "sport and recreation" subscale. Smaller ST graft than estimated was not a risk factor for revision ACLR.</AbstractText>

TI  - Outcome instruments for patellofemoral arthroplasty.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Although there are numerous patient outcome instruments available, the most reliable and valid instruments for evaluating patient outcomes after patellofemoral arthroplasty have not been identified. In this article, we review and evaluate the psychometric properties and practical considerations of administering general health instruments (Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form-36 and Short Form-12), knee scales (Knee Society Clinical Rating System, Knee Outcome Survey, International Knee Documentation Committee form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) and a disease specific scale (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) for patellofemoral arthroplasty outcome assessment. Based on our review of the literature, we recommend the Short Form-36 and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for evaluation of patellofemoral arthroplasty outcomes and provide recommendations for implementation of these instruments in a clinical setting.

TI  - Gait Mechanics After ACL Reconstruction Differ According to Medial Meniscal Treatment
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background Knee osteoarthritis risk is high after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and arthroscopic meniscal surgery, and higher among individuals who undergo both. Although osteoarthritis development is multifactorial, altered walking mechanics may influence osteoarthritis progression. The purpose of this study was to compare gait mechanics after ACLR among participants who had undergone no medial meniscal surgery, partial medial meniscectomy, or medial meniscal repair. Methods This was a secondary analysis of data collected prospectively as part of a clinical trial. Sixty-one athletes (mean age of 21.4 ± 8.2 years) who had undergone primary ACLR participated in the study when they achieved impairment resolution (5.3 ± 1.7 months postoperatively), including minimal to no effusion, full knee range of motion, and ≥80% quadriceps-strength symmetry. Participants were classified by concomitant medial meniscal treatment: no involvement or nonsurgical management of a small, stable tear; partial meniscectomy; or meniscal repair. Participants underwent comprehensive walking analyses. Joint contact forces were estimated using a previously validated, electromyography-driven musculoskeletal model. Variables were analyzed using a mixed-model analysis of variance with group and limb comparisons (α = 0.05); group comparisons of interlimb differences in measurements (surgical minus contralateral limb) were performed to determine significant interactions. Results The participants in the partial meniscectomy group walked with a higher peak knee adduction moment (pKAM) in the surgical versus the contralateral limb as compared with those in the meniscal repair group and those with no medial meniscal surgery (group difference for partial versus repair: 0.10 N-m/kg-m, p = 0.020; and for partial versus none: 0.06 N-m/kg-m, p = 0.037). Participants in the repair group walked with a smaller percentage of medial to total tibiofemoral loading in the surgical limb compared with both of the other groups (group difference for repair versus partial: -12%, p = 0.001; and for repair versus none: -7%, p = 0.011). The participants in the repair group loaded the medial compartment of the surgical versus the contralateral limb 0.5 times body weight less than did the participants in the partial meniscectomy group. Conclusions Participants in the partial meniscectomy group walked with higher pKAM and shifted loading toward the medial compartment of the surgical limb, while participants in the repair group did the opposite, walking with lower pKAM and unloading the surgical limb relative to the contralateral limb. These findings may partially explain the conflicting evidence regarding pKAM after ACLR and the elevated risk for osteoarthritis (whether from overloading or underloading) after ACLR with concomitant medial meniscectomy or repair. Level of evidence Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Clinical Outcome Assessment of Repaired Articular Cartilage
PY  - 2020
AB  - Measuring outcomes following articular cartilage repair should be performed using instruments that have demonstrated content validity as well as adequate psychometric properties including reliability, construct validity and responsiveness in this population of interest. As per the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) recommendation, the primary outcome for articular cartilage surgery should be either the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) or the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC). Secondary outcomes should include an activity scale as well as a measure of generic health-related quality of life (QoL) which can concomitantly allow for an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of a group of interventions. Such a biopsychosocial approach towards outcome measurement will allow for a comprehensive understanding of how patients experience articular cartilage pathology and how they respond to treatment over time.

TI  - Response shift in self-reported functional scores after knee microfracture for full thickness cartilage lesions.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary Objective Our aim was to determine whether response shift (RS), a change in the internal standards of a patient, occurs in patients treated for full thickness knee cartilage defects. We have also evaluated the effect of functional scores on patient satisfaction after surgery. Design Self-administered questionnaires were used to evaluate pre- and post-operative and retrospective post-operative scores of 53 patients following knee microfracture. Patient satisfaction, Lysholm, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and modified International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were evaluated. RS (pre-test–then-test), unadjusted and adjusted treatment effects (UTE and ATE) and their effect sizes were calculated. Results All four functional outcome measures had a positive RS. The effect size of the RS ranged from around 0.35 for the Lysholm and IKDC2 score to over 0.9 for the VAS pain score. Gender, age, smoking status and time since follow-up did not significantly affect the RS. RS did not differ significantly between the three patient satisfaction groups ( P >0.05). Post-operative Lysholm and IKDC1 scores differed most significantly between the satisfaction groups. Conclusions All four scores had a significant shift, implying that patients thought they felt worse before the operation in retrospect than they did at the time. The traditional way of assessing treatment effect, difference between post-intervention and pre-intervention functional scores, may be confounded by change in the internal standards of the patient and should take this into account. RS did not affect the clinical interpretation in this case series. Patient-reported satisfaction after surgery is only related to post-operative scores.

TI  - Comparison of outcome after ACL reconstruction in terms of subjective assessment of symptoms and function and clinical assessment of ligament stability.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Background The knee joint is frequently involved in sports and other injuries with Anterior cruciate ligament being a very common ligament to be injured. The Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and instrumented knee laxity examination are frequently used and reported for evaluation of ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study is to examine and evaluate the relationships between the clinical assessment of ligament stability and subjective assessment of symptoms and function after ACL reconstruction. Methods A total of 50 young and middle aged patients with unilateral knee ACL injury treated with ACL reconstruction using hamstring graft were evaluated for a minimum period of 1 year. Clinical assessment of ligament stability was done through Lachman and pivot-shift examination. Subjective variables of symptoms at follow-up included pain, swelling, instability and locking of knee. Subjective function at follow up included satisfaction with outcome, squatting, ascending or descending stairs, jumping, twisting and Lysholm score. Results Lachman Examination at follow-up had no significant (P > .05) relationship with pain, swelling, instability, locking, squatting, ascending or descending stairs, jumping, twisting, satisfaction with outcome and Lysholm score. Pivot-shift examination at follow-up had significant associations with patient satisfaction (P = .04), instability of knee (P = .02), difficulty during twisting (P = .02) and Lysholm score (P = .01). Conclusion Pivot-shift examination is a better measure than Lachman examination or instrumented knee laxity as far as patients’ functional outcome and overall satisfaction is concerned.

TI  - Surgical technique: articulated external fixator for treatment of complex knee dislocation.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background
Knee dislocation is a severe but relatively uncommon injury caused by violent trauma that can result in long-term complications, such as arthrofibrosis, stiffness, instability, and pain. Perhaps owing in part to its rarity, treatment of this injury is controversial. We therefore describe a treatment approach for these complex cases involving a novel dynamic knee external fixator.

TI  - Surgical management of traumatic knee dislocation with posterolateral corner injury.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the results of our method of surgical treatment of traumatic knee dislocation with injury to the posterolateral corner by use of a standardized protocol. Methods Twenty-five consecutive patients presented with a grossly dislocated or reduced knee. Five of these patients were not included in this series. The remaining 20 patients were treated by primary arthroscopic reconstruction. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) was reconstructed using gracilis tendon reinforced with artificial ligament (Ligament Augmentation and Reconstruction System [LARS] ligament); the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was reconstructed with semitendinosus tendon and reinforced with LARS ligament; and the posterolateral corner was treated using the gracilis and semitendinosus tendons from the uninjured knee. Twenty patients returned for subjective and objective evaluation at a minimum of 24 months after surgery. Early mobilization through continuous and active exercise was started on the fourth day postoperatively. Results At a mean follow-up of 44 months, the mean Lysholm score was 90 points, the mean score on the survey of daily activities was 90 points, and the sports activities score on the knee outcome survey averaged 80 points. By the rating of Meyers et al. the results were excellent in 6 patients, good in 10 patients, fair in 3 patients, and poor in one patient. The final International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) rating was not normal in any knee. The mean loss of extension was 2° (range, 0° to 3°) and loss of flexion was 12° (range, 10° to 15°). Conclusions By using the described method of arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of the cruciate ligaments and the posterolateral corner, 80% of the patients had good subjective results and functional stability, and according to the IKDC scale, 45% of knees were nearly normal, 45% were abnormal, and 10% were severely abnormal. No patient's rating returned to normal. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Arthroscopically Assisted Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendon Graft in Reconstruction for Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in Athletes
PY  - 1996
AB  - We evaluated 69 arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions for acute tears at an average followup of 60 months. We used a distally based single semitendinosus and gracilis tendon graft passed over the top and fixed to the femur. Combined medial collateral ligament lesions were seen in 30 knees, and they were repaired when found in the distal third (18 knees). The patients were instructed to recover motion preoperatively, and an early range of motion program was used postoperatively. At followup, symptoms of giving way were seen in five knees (7%). Graft failure was seen in seven knees (10%); failure was defined as a positive pivot shift (clunk or gross) or a side-to-side difference in anterior tibial displacement greater than 5 mm, as measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer. Permanent extension loss (3 degrees to 5 degrees) was found in two knees (3%). Patellofemoral crepitation was seen in eight knees (12%), but the condition was symptomatic in only one knee. Forty-six patients (67%) were active in pivoting sports before surgery and 37 (54%) remained active in these sports at followup. We concluded that this operation is simple, effective, and has a low complication rate. Further studies are necessary to elucidate if a stronger graft (e.g., a patellar tendon) would decrease the rate of graft failure without increasing complications.

TI  - Effect of Initial Graft Tension on Knee Stability and Graft Tension Pattern in Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose To determine the initial minimal tension for restoring knee stability during double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in vivo. Methods Patients who underwent primary double-bundle ACL reconstruction with an autologous semitendinosus tendon during 2012 were included. The bundles were fixed to a graft-tensioning system during surgery. Initial graft tensions were set to the following tensions per 6 mm in graft diameter: (1) 30 N, (2) 25 N, and (3) 20 N. Bundle tension was recorded during knee flexion-extension and in response to anterior or rotatory loads. In addition, anterior knee laxity was measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and the pivot-shift test was evaluated. Results Sixty patients were evaluated. The tension curves of both bundles among different initial tension settings were significantly different ( P P  = .019). The tension of the posterolateral bundle graft was significantly lower than that of the anteromedial bundle graft in response to the anterior load at all settings ( P  = .0017, P  = .0019, and P  = .0021 at 30° in the 30-N, 25-N, and 20-N settings, respectively, and P Conclusions In double-bundle ACL reconstruction, initial tension could be set as low as 25 N; however, initial tension of 20 N is not recommended because it might result in residual pivot shift in some cases, although the pivot-shift difference was not significant. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

PY  - 2011
AB  - Patient-reported measures of knee function are important for the comprehensive assessment of rheumatology conditions in both clinical and research contexts. To merit inclusion in this review, measures of knee function were required to be patient reported and assess aspects considered important by adult patients with knee problems such as injury or osteoarthritis (OA). Therefore, measures used in rheumatology, orthopedics, and sports medicine were considered. Dimensions deemed to be important to patients included pain, function, quality of life, and activity level. To identify instruments fulfilling these criteria, we utilized published reviews of knee instruments (1), knee OA instruments (2), and measures for use in patellofemoral arthroplasty (3).

Based on these reviews, as well as extensive searches of more recent literature, we included the following 9 patient-reported outcomes: Activity Rating Scale, International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Physical Function Short Form, Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living Scale, Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, Tegner Activity Scale, Oxford Knee Score, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Although the WOMAC can be applied to the hip and knee, this study contains data only applicable to the knee. Measures assessing activity level are listed separately.

Psychometric data pertaining to the reliability and responsiveness of each patient-reported outcome are shown in Tables 1 and ​and2.2. The number of psychometric reports concerning each instrument ranges from 2–27. A higher number of reports indicates a higher degree of certainty in interpretation of the psychometric properties.



Table 1

Summary of reliability data*





Table 2

Summary of responsiveness data*



Psychometric properties were based on data provided in Tables 1 and 2, and interpreted using standardized guidelines. Internal consistency was considered adequate if Cronbach’s alpha was at least 0.7 (4), and test–retest (intra-rater) reliability was adequate if the intraclass correlation coefficient was at least 0.8 for groups and 0.9 for individuals (5). Floor and ceiling effects were considered to be absent if no participants scored the bottom or top score, respectively, and acceptable if 0.8 were considered large (9). In this context, the minimum clinically important difference is the amount of change of a patient-reported outcome that represents a meaningful change to the patient, while the patient-acceptable symptom state is the least abnormal function score at which patients would consider themselves having acceptable function (10).

AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is common after ACL injury, particularly in young, active individuals. However, after ACL reconstruction not all athletes will return to sport and these individuals are at a high risk for a second ACL injury and osteoarthritis. This chapter will discuss the screening algorithms available to evaluate athletes shortly after ACL injury and help determine who are good candidates to pursue nonoperative management and return to sport. Further, research has shown that with extended physical therapy following an ACL injury, many athletes can return to their prior level of sports without ACL reconstruction. With recent evidence that outcomes after operative and nonoperative ACL injury management do not necessarily favor surgery, the authors recommend that athletes undergo physical therapy and screening following ACL injury in order to determine if they may be a candidate for nonoperative management, as the decision to pursue nonoperative management is reversible, but ACL reconstruction is final.

TI  - Prevalence of post-traumatic osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament injury remains high despite advances in surgical techniques.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Aims" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The aim of this study was to report the pooled prevalence of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) and examine whether the risk of developing PTOA after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury has decreased in recent decades.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched from 1 January 1980 to 11 May 2022. Patient series, observational studies, and clinical trials having reported the prevalence of radiologically confirmed PTOA after ACL injury, with at least a ten-year follow-up, were included. All studies were analyzed simultaneously, and separate analyses of the operative and nonoperative knees were performed. The prevalence of PTOA was calculated separately for each study, and pooled prevalence was reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using either a fixed or random effects model. To examine the effect of the year of injury on the prevalence, a logit transformed meta-regression analysis was used with a maximum-likelihood estimator. Results from meta-regression analyses were reported with the unstandardized coefficient (β).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The pooled prevalence of PTOA was 37.9% (95% CI 32.1 to 44) for operatively treated ACL injuries with a median follow-up of 14.6 years (interquartile range (IQR) 10.6 to 16.7). For nonoperatively treated ACL injuries, the prevalence was 40.5% (95% CI 28.9 to 53.3), with a median of follow-up of 15 years (IQR 11.7 to 20.0). The association between the year of operation and the prevalence of PTOA was weak and imprecise and not related to the choice of treatment (operative β -0.038 (95% CI -0.076 to 0.000) and nonoperative β -0.011 (95% CI -0.101 to 0.079)).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The initial injury, irrespective of management, has, by the balance of probability, resulted in PTOA within 20 years. In addition, the prevalence of PTOA has only slightly decreased during past decades. Therefore, further research is warranted to develop strategies to prevent the development of PTOA after ACL injuries.</AbstractText>

TI  - Risk Factors for Abnormal Anteroposterior Knee Laxity After Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Purpose To identify preoperative and intraoperative factors associated with abnormal anterior knee laxity after primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods A total of 5,462 patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction at our institution from January 2000 to October 2015, with no associated ligament injuries, were included. Demographic data, information regarding graft used, concomitant meniscal surgery, and instrumented laxity were reviewed. The KT-1000 arthrometer, with an anterior tibial load of 134 N, was used to evaluate knee laxity preoperatively and at 6-month follow-up. Patients were considered to have abnormal anterior knee laxity if the postoperative side-to-side difference was greater than 5 mm (International Knee Documentation Committee laxity grade C or D). A logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate whether patient age, gender, preoperative knee laxity, graft type, and presence of medial or lateral meniscus resection or suture were risk factors for abnormal knee laxity. Results The risk of having abnormal anterior knee laxity was significantly related to younger age ( P  = .016), preoperative side-to-side difference greater than 5 mm (OR, 6.57; 95% CI, 4.94-8.73; P P  = .025), and medial meniscus resection (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.61-3.07; P P  = .80), medial meniscus suture (OR, 0.82; 95% CI 0.42-1.62; P  = .58), lateral meniscus resection (OR, 0.73; 95% CI 0.49-1.10; P  = .13), and lateral meniscus suture (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.46-2.11; P  = .98) were not associated with increased risk of abnormal knee laxity. Conclusions Age less than 30 years, preoperative side-to-side difference greater than 5 mm, hamstring tendon graft, and medial meniscus resection are associated with increased risk of having abnormal anterior knee laxity 6 months after primary ACL reconstruction. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative trial.

TI  - Effect of bone marrow aspiration concentrate and platelet-rich plasma combination in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a randomized, prospective, double-blinded study.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">The effect of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) combination in enhancing graft maturation and tendon-bone tunnel interfacial healing after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction remains unclear. We hypothesised that BMAC and PRP combination could lead to better clinical results and better graft maturation/interface healing than PRP alone or conventional ACL reconstruction without any other biologic augmentation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">In this randomised double-blind prospective study, patients undergoing ACL reconstruction surgery were randomly assigned into three groups: (1) control group (without any biologic augmentation), (2) PRP treatment group, and (3) combined BMAC and PRP (BMAC + PRP) group. Moreover, they were evaluated using the clinical functional score, laxity examination, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">No significant difference was observed in the improvement of functional scores among groups. However, laxity improvement at 24 weeks showed a significant difference with the BMAC + PRP group having the lowest laxity. MRI analysis showed no significant change in whole graft maturation among groups. In particular, the BMAC + PRP group showed delayed signal peak and higher graft signal at 24 weeks compared with the other two groups; however, the difference was not significant. With regard to tendon-bone interfacial healing, the BMAC + PRP group showed significantly wider tendon-bone interface in the femoral bone tunnel at 24 weeks compared with the other two groups. Moreover, the BMAC + PRP group showed significantly higher peri-tunnel edema signal in the femoral bone tunnel at 12 weeks compared with the other two groups.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">PRP alone and BMAC and PRP combination showed limited enhancing effect in clinical function, graft maturation and tendon-bone interfacial healing compared with control (no additional treatment). When BMAC is used in ACL reconstruction, the possibility of greater inflammation in the early stage to graft maturation and bone tunnel healing should be considered.</AbstractText>

TI  - FUNCTIONAL EVOLUTION OF MENISCAL REPAIR USING ABSORBABLE IMPLANTS.
PY  - 2015
AB  - To evaluate the functional evolution of knees after repair of longitudinal meniscal rupture with absorbable arrow implant. Methods: Between June 1997 and February 2001, 23 patients with a mean age of 26.3 years were evaluated. The mean follow-up time was 72.87 months (45-96). We performed 19 medial and 4 lateral meniscal repairs. The patients were pre and postoperatively evaluated regarding joint function according to the Lysholm scale, and, postoperatively, according to IKDC. Results: For better understanding, the 23 treated cases were divided into three groups. Twenty one had ACL injuries, eleven of whom were submitted to ligament reconstruction (Group I). All these 11 cases were regarded as satisfactory. The remaining 10 cases of the 21 with ACL lesion were not submitted to ligament reconstruction (Group II). Of these, 5 evolved satisfactorily, not requiring ligament reconstruction. The remaining five evolved with complaint of ligament instability, being all submitted to reconstruction. Four of these had an integral meniscus and one presented a failure of the medial meniscus. The remaining two cases who did not present ACL injury (Group III), one patient evolved satisfactorily and one developed a failure of the lateral meniscus. According to the Lysholm scale, preoperative mean score was 57.53 and the postoperative mean score was 86.95, evidencing a statistically significant improvement (Wilcoxon p < 0.01). The non-parametric ANOVA was employed for ordinal data with repeated measurements to assess pre- and postoperative measurements, considering Groups I and II. We assessed knee stabilization and found no statistically significant difference between Groups I and II (p = 0.648). Even if there were differences between the two groups, both had the same behavior. On postoperative assessment with IKDC, 4 patients were grade A, 13 were grade B, and 6 were grade C. Two C results were caused by a meniscal rupture. Conclusion: Of the 23 patients, only two presented known failures of the sutured meniscus. According to the Lysholm scale, there was a significant improvement in the treated patients. The ACL repair caused no bias on the results.

TI  - A comparison of quadruple semitendinosus and patellar tendon grafts in reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.
PY  - 2001
AB  - In a two-centre study, 164 patients with unilateral instability of the anterior cruciate ligament were prospectively randomised to arthroscopic reconstruction with either a patellar tendon graft using interference screw fixation or a quadruple semitendinosus graft using an endobutton fixation technique. The same postoperative rehabilitation protocol was used for all patients and follow-up at a median of 31 months (24 to 59) was carried out by independent observers. Four patients (2%) were lost to follow-up. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding the Stryker laxity test, one-leg hop test, Tegner activity level, Lysholm score, patellofemoral pain score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score or visual analogue scale, reflecting patient satisfaction and knee function. Slightly decreased extension, compared with the non-operated side, was found in the patellar tendon group (p < 0.05). Patients with associated meniscal injuries had lower IKDC, visual analogue (p < 0.01) and Lysholm scores (p < 0.05) than those without such injuries. Patients in whom reconstruction had been carried out less than five months after the injury had better final IKDC scores than the more chronic cases (p < 0.05). We conclude that patellar tendon and quadruple semitendinous tendon grafts have similar outcomes in the medium term. Associated meniscal pathology significantly affects the final outcome and early reconstruction seems to be beneficial.

          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A literature search was performed according to the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using the Scopus, PubMed, and Embase computerized databases. Clinical studies evaluating partial meniscectomy or meniscal repair for HCTs were included.

          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 18 studies comprising 833 patients with HCTs were included, of which 562 patients (67.5%) were treated with partial meniscectomy and 271 (32.5%) with meniscal repair. Both types of treatments reported improved clinical outcomes, including International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and Tegner scores. Failure rates were reported to range between 0% and 15% following partial meniscectomy and from 0% to 17.6% following repair; complications were 7.5% after partial meniscectomy and between 3.8% and 21.4% following meniscal repair. Patients undergoing meniscectomy demonstrated progression of degenerative changes on radiographic assessments.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Repair of HCTs in the appropriately indicated patient can result in similar patient outcomes and failure rates compared to partial meniscectomy.

TI  - Four-strand hamstring tendon autograft for ACL reconstruction in patients aged 50 years or older.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary Introduction Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using a four-strand hamstring tendon autograft in symptomatic patients aged 50 years or older is an accepted treatment option. Hypotesis Four-strand hamstring tendon autograft although not universally utilized in patients who are at least 50 years old is an efficient procedure to control knee instability. Material and methods In this retrospective, we analyzed the clinical outcomes of 18 patients treated from September 1998 to September 2003. Criteria for inclusion were the following: age above 50 years at surgery, chronic anterior laxity associated or not with meniscal damage; one or more episodes of knee instability and no prior ligament surgery on the involved knee. A same operative technique (arthroscopic single-bundle four-strand hamstring reconstruction, blind femoral tunnel, through anteromedial portals), a same fixation type (absorbable interference screws in femur and tibia) and a same rehabilitation protocol were used for all these knees. The IKDC 93 scores were determined pre- and postoperatively combined with anteroposterior and lateral views, single leg stance, 30° flexion stance, and passive Lachman test (Telos) postoperatively. Results At mean 30 month-follow-up (range 12–59 months), there were no graft failure and no loss of extension for any of these knees. Three patients complained of hypoesthesia in the medial saphenous nerve territory and one patient experienced posterior knee pain. All patients graded their knee as normal or nearly normal, all were satisfied or very satisfied with their operation. None of the patients reported instability. The Lachman-Trillat test was noted “firm end point” in 14 knees and “delayed firm end point” in four. The pivot-shift test was negative in 16 knees and mild positive in two. The mean residual differential laxity was 3.1 mm (0 to +6 mm) for the passive Lachman test. At last follow-up, the overall IKDC score was 7 A, 7 B, 3 C, and 1 D. Patients with preserved meniscus (nine patients) reported a lesser degree of pain and a better residual laxity control compared with patients who had undergone a meniscectomy. Conclusion Age over 50 years is not a contraindication to select a hamstring tendon autograft for ACL reconstruction. This surgery can restore knee stability but does not modify the pain pattern in patients, who had a medial meniscectomy prior to the ACL reconstruction. Level of evidence: level IV, therapeutic study.

TI  - Pre-operative quadriceps strength predicts IKDC2000 scores 6 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2012
AB  - Abstract Level of evidence Level II. Background Quadriceps strength deficits are ubiquitous after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Deficits prior to surgery can influence knee function post-operatively. Inhibition contributes to quadriceps strength deficits after an ACL injury. Body mass index, meniscal injury, and sex influence functional outcomes after ACL reconstruction. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship of pre-operative quadriceps strength and post-operative knee function and to investigate how other pre-operative factors may influence this relationship. Methods After an ACL injury, subjects received pre-operative rehabilitation and performed quadriceps strength testing. Subjects underwent reconstruction and post-operative rehabilitation. Six months after ACL reconstruction, subjects completed the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 subjective form (IKDC2000). Linear regression models were developed using IKDC2000 scores at 6 months after ACL reconstruction as the dependent variable. Results Fifty-five subjects had complete pre-operative data and IKDC2000 scores at 6 months after ACL reconstruction. Pre-operative involved quadriceps strength was a significant predictor for IKDC2000 scores 6 months after ACL reconstruction. Sex, meniscal injury, pre-operative BMI, and pre-operative involved quadriceps activation ratio were not significant predictors in the regression model. Conclusions Pre-operative quadriceps strength can predict IKDC2000 scores 6 months after ACL reconstruction. Deficits in pre-operative quadriceps strength influence self-reported function 6 months after surgery. Factors that are known to influence quadriceps strength and self-reported outcomes do not influence the relationship between pre-operative quadriceps strength and post-operative IKDC2000 scores.

TI  - Increased knee laxity with hamstring tendon autograft compared to patellar tendon autograft: a cohort study of 5462 patients with primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2018
AB  - To compare anterior knee laxity and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) between anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) performed with bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) and hamstring tendon (HT) autografts and, moreover, to study any correlation between postoperative anterior knee laxity and PROMs. Patients who underwent primary ACLR at Capio Artro Clinic, Stockholm, Sweden, from January 2000 to October 2015, were identified in our local database. Instrumented laxity measurements and PROMs were reviewed. The KT-1000 arthrometer, with an anterior tibial load of 134-N, was used to evaluate knee laxity preoperatively and at the 6-month follow-up. The Lysholm score was collected preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was collected preoperatively and at the 1-year follow-up. A total of 5462 primary ACLRs, 692 BPTBs and 4770 HT autografts were included in the study. All the patients showed a significant reduction in knee laxity from preoperatively to postoperatively (BPTB group: from 3.8 ± 2.6 to 1.2 ± 2.1 mm; HT group: from 3.6 ± 3.1 to 1.8 ± 2.2 mm; P   5 mm, was found in the HT group compared with the BPTB group at follow-up (4.3 vs 2.4%; P   5 mm) compared with BPTB autograft. The BPTB autograft showed a larger anterior knee laxity reduction (ATT reduction) in conjunction with primary ACLR. The HT autograft led to a significantly larger improvement in four of five KOOS subscales from preoperatively to the 1-year follow-up, compared with BPTB autograft. There was no association between postoperative anterior knee laxity and PROMs for either graft. The findings of the present study provide clinicians with valuable information regarding differences in knee laxity and subjective knee function between BPTB and HT autograft after primary ACLR. The use of BPTB autograft should be considered for patients with high knee stability demands. Retrospective cohort study, Level III.

TI  - Arthroscopic popliteus bypass graft for posterolateral instabilities of the knee : A new surgical technique.
PY  - 2015
AB  - An arthroscopic technique for the reconstruction of the posterolateral corner combined with posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction was developed. Posterolateral rotational instabilities of the knee. Combined lesions of the PCL, the popliteus complex (PLT) and the posterolateral corner. Isolated PLT lesions lacking static stabilizing function. Neuromuscular disorders; knee deformities or fractures; severe posterolateral soft tissue damage. Six arthroscopic portals are necessary. Using the posteromedial portal, resect dorsal septum with a shaver. Visualize the PCL, the lateral femoral condyle and the posterolateral recessus with the PLT. Dissect the popliteomeniscal fibers; retract PLT until sulcus popliteus is visualized. Drill a 6-mm tunnel anteriorly into the distal third of the sulcus popliteus. Visualize femoral footprint of the PLT and place an anatomical drill tunnel. Pull the popliteus bypass graft into the knee and fix with bioscrews. Fix the reconstructed PCL. In cases of additional LCL injury, reconstruct LCL with autologous graft. Partial weight-bearing for 6 weeks, range of motion exercises, quadriceps-strengthening exercises on postoperative day 1. Full extension allowed immediately with flexion limited to 20° for 2 weeks, to 45° for up to week 4, and to 60° up to week 6. Use a PCL brace for 3 months, running and squatting exercises allowed after 3 months. In the 35 patients treated, no technique-related complications. After 1 year, 12 patients had a mean Lysholm Score of 88.6 (± 8.7) points and a side-to-side difference in the posterior drawer test of 2.9 (± 2.2) mm (preoperative 13.3 [± 1.9] mm). Low complication risk and good and excellent clinical results after arthroscopic posterolateral corner reconstruction.

TI  - Anatomical single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with rounded rectangle tibial tunnel and oval femoral tunnel: a prospective comparative study versus conventional surgery.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Conventional anatomical single bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction technique with round tunnels could not simulate morphology of native insertion, while studies about ACL reconstruction technique with modified tunnels based on morphology of anatomical insertion are rare. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate an ACL reconstruction technique with rounded rectangle tibial tunnel and oval femoral tunnel and compare clinical outcomes with conventional technique. A prospective comparative study was performed in 80 consecutive subjects who underwent ACL reconstruction with the conventional round tunnels (RT-Group, n=40) or modified tunnels (MT-Group, n=40). For the modified surgery, the tunnel was modified with a bone file based on the anatomical direction and area of the remnant insertion fibers. Graft maturity were evaluated by MR images at 12 months postoperatively and patients were examined for functional scores, physical examinations at 2-year follow-up. The primary variable was the pivot-shift test. No serious complications were experienced in either group. Seventy patients (87.5%) were examined at 2-year follow-up, significant improvements were seen in both groups compared with the preoperative values in terms of all clinical assessments. Tegner scores, pivot-shift test results and SNQ value in the MT-Group were significantly better than RT-Group (P=0.04, P=0.03 and P=0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences in Lysholm scores, IKDC scores, KT-2000 measurements and Lachman tests. We successfully developed the ACL reconstruction technique with rounded rectangle tibial tunnel and oval femoral tunnel, which was superior to conventional technique in terms of postoperative Tegner scores, pivot-shift tests and early graft maturity.

TI  - Association Between Impairments and Function in Individuals with Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome
PY  - 2005
AB  - Purpose: To identify baseline impairments associated with physical function and to identify what changes in impairments are associated with functional outcome in patients with PFPS following a standardized physical therapy (PT) treatment at 2 and 6-month follow-ups. Subjects: 74 patients diagnosed with PFPS and referred to PT treatment. Methods: Correlational, predictive design. Baseline measurement session was performed to complete demographic questionnaires, self-reported measures, and undergo a physical exam. Impairments measured during physical exam included quadriceps strength, hip abduction strength, hip external rotation strength, hamstrings length, quadriceps length, plantar flexors length, ITB/TFL complex length, lateral retinacular length, foot pronation, Q-angle, tibial torsion, quality of movement, pain, and anxiety. Following the baseline, subjects participated in a standardized PT program. Then, measurement sessions were performed at 2 and 6-month follow-ups. Analyses: Association between baseline impairment and function used a stepwise multiple regression in which potential confounder variables (age, sex, activity level, height and weight) were forced into the model as a single block. Then, impairment measures were entered in a stepwise procedure. Function measured by the Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADLS) was the criterion variable. Association between changes in impairment and function outcome was investigated with two stepwise multiple regressions, one with the 2 and the other with the 6-month follow-up data. The criterion variable was the ADLS of the respective follow-up controlled by the baseline ADLS. First, potential confounders were forced into the model as a single block. Then, changes in impairments and baseline pain were entered in a stepwise procedure. Results and Clinical Relevance: At baseline our study indicates that after controlling the confounders, pain and tightness of lateral retinaculum predicted baseline function. Data suggested that pain may mediate the relationship between anxiety and function in patients with PFPS and the role of pain and anxiety in the prediction of function should be considered together with this population. At the 2 and 6-month follow-ups, after controlling the confounders, increased gastrocnemius length and increased quadriceps length predicted functional outcome, respectively. It seems that clinicians should specifically target impairments of soft tissue length in an attempt to improve functional outcome in patients with PFPS.

TI  - Electromyographic examination of knee training using a hybrid assistive limb after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A case report.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Muscle co-contraction can result in higher joint contact forces, compromising knee joint mobility for stability, thus leading to impaired lower extremity neuromuscular control, delayed return to sports, and increased incidence of secondary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury post-ACL reconstruction. Hybrid assistive limb (HAL) training has the potential to correct impairment of antagonistic or synergistic muscle movement of the knee joint through bioelectric signal feedback from muscle signals with computer processing. We considered that HAL training would contribute to improve peak muscle torque through coordinating or decreasing higher levels of muscle co-contractions and reducing differences between hamstring and quadriceps muscle activity on electromyography (EMG). While playing handball, a 20-year-old female injured her ACL upon landing on one leg. Two months post-injury, she underwent arthroscopic, anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction with a semitendinosus tendon autograft. At a 4-month follow-up, she underwent knee HAL training, which was performed once a week for three sessions. EMG data were collected during the evaluations of pre- and post-HAL training. The average muscle amplitude was used to calculate the difference between vastus lateralis (VL) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles, and the muscle co-contraction index (CCI). The CCI reflects the simultaneous activation of antagonistic muscles, which is determined for knee extensor-flexor muscle pairs. Post-knee HAL training, the CCI of the lateral hamstring and quadriceps muscles during extension was lower than that during pre-HAL training in all sessions. However, no differences were found in the CCI for the medial hamstring and quadriceps muscles during extension and flexion pre- and post-knee HAL training. For post-knee HAL training, the difference between VL and ST EMG data during a closed-chain squat was lower than that during pre-HAL training in all sessions. Knee HAL training contributed to improved peak muscle torque through coordinating or decreasing higher levels of muscle co-contractions, and it reduced differences between hamstring and quadriceps muscle activity in the ACL reconstructed leg as depicted by EMG.

          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This retrospective study included patients who underwent primary double-bundle ACLR with meniscal repair between June 2016 and June 2021, with a 2-year minimum follow-up. Meniscal healing was evaluated by second-look arthroscopy at least 1 year postoperatively, and knee laxity was measured under general anesthesia preoperatively, intraoperatively, and at second-look arthroscopy.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Of 562 knees treated with ACLR, 113 knees, with 137 meniscal repairs, were analyzed. Second-look arthroscopy classified 114 menisci (83.2%) as healed and 23 (16.8%) as failed. The side-to-side difference in anterior tibial translation (ATT) and the side-to-side ratios of tibial acceleration and external rotational angular velocity (ERAV) improved intraoperatively in both groups (ATT, 6.0 to -1.0 mm [P &lt; .001] and 6.0 to -1.0 mm [P &lt; .001]; acceleration, 5.1 to 1.2 and 4.9 to 1.1 [P &lt; .001]; ERAV, 3.6 to 1.3 and 3.6 to 1.6 [P &lt; .001]). There were no significant differences in ATT and patient-reported outcome measures, including the Lysholm score and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), between the groups. The proportion of patients achieving the minimal clinically important difference for the Lysholm score and KOOS did not differ significantly between the groups. However, at 1 year postoperatively, acceleration and ERAV were higher in the failed group than in the healed group (P &lt; .001).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Patients with failure of meniscal repair performed concomitantly with ACLR showed significantly greater rotational knee laxity at the time of second-look arthroscopy. These patients exhibited significantly higher preoperative and postoperative pivot-shift grades than those who did not experience failure of meniscal repair. There were no significant differences in ATT and patient-reported outcome measures between the groups.</AbstractText>

PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Diagnosing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in children and adolescents are more challenging compared to adults. Delayed diagnosis may result in meniscal or chondral injuries. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic values of history taking, physical examination and KT-1000 arthrometer for suspect ACL injuries in children and adolescents.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">In this prospective diagnostic study, all children and adolescents (&lt; 18 years) with post-traumatic knee complaints presenting at the out-patient department of the Máxima MC were eligible for inclusion. One experienced knee specialised orthopaedic surgeon was blinded and performed history taking, physical examination and KT-1000 arthrometer measurement. All patients had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the final diagnosis. Diagnostic values of interest were sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV). The outcomes of the KT-1000 arthrometer were drafted in a relative operating characteristics (ROC) curve to determine the optimal cut-off points.</AbstractText>

TI  - Surgical outcome of 2-stage management of multiple knee ligament injuries after knee dislocation.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a new 2-stage surgical treatment for acute traumatic knee dislocation. Methods: The study involved 15 knees in 14 patients treated between October 1997 and November 2001. The mean follow-up was 88.9 months (range, 35 to 110 months). In the first surgical stage, medial or lateral ligament complexes were repaired or reconstructed within 2 weeks of injury. In the second surgical stage, once full range of motion was obtained 3 to 6 months later, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was reconstructed if significant laxity was present. The final outcomes were assessed based on stress radiographs, range of motion, Lysholm score, Tegner activity stage, and International Knee Documentation Committee rating. Results: There were 10 cases of medial collateral ligament (MCL) tear and 8 cases of lateral collateral ligament (LCL) tear. All MCL and LCL injuries were either repaired or reconstructed. All cases had both ACL and PCL tears. After the first stage of MCL/LCL complex surgery, the second-stage surgery involving ACL and PCL reconstruction was deemed necessary in 3 and 7 cases, respectively. Five cases did not require ACL or PCL reconstruction. On stress radiography at the last follow-up, MCL, LCL, ACL, and PCL instability was graded as 0 to 1 in 15, 14, 15, and 11 cases, respectively. PCL instability was graded as 2 in 4 cases. The mean postoperative Lysholm score was 87.6 points. Conclusions: The 2-stage surgical approach described resulted in good outcomes for acute knee dislocation patients in terms of range of motion and stability. Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - After revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, who returns to sport? A systematic review and meta-analysis
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background Return to sport and to pre-injury level represents an important outcome after both primary and revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions. Purpose The aim of the present meta-analysis was to determine the return to sport rate after revision ACL reconstruction. Material and methods A systematic search was performed of the MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Databases. All the studies that reported return to sport, return to pre-injury sport level and return to high level/competitive sport was considered for the meta-analysis. The overall pooled mean of post-operative knee laxity and pooled rate of positive pivot-shift and objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) categories was calculated as well. Results Overall, 472 abstracts were identified and screened for inclusion and only 16 studies reported the rate of return to any level of sport activity at the final follow-up of 4.7 years (range 1.0–13.2 years), showing a pooled rate of 85.3% (CI 79.7 to 90.2). The return to pre-injury sport level was achieved in 53.4% (CI 37.8 to 68.7) of cases. Normal or quasi-normal objective IKDC, less than 5 mm of side-to-side difference at arthrometric evaluations and grade I-II pivot-shift test were reported in 84%, 88% and 93% patients, respectively. Conclusions In spite of almost 8 patients out of 10 returning to sport after revision ACL reconstruction and showing good stability, only half of the patients returned to the same pre-injury sport level.

TI  - The stability of EMG median frequency under different muscle contraction conditions and following anterior cruciate ligament injury
PY  - 2004
AB  - Musculoskeletal injuries are commonly associated with muscle atrophy as a function of immobilization or change of normal function.

For example, injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) which may involve ligament reconstruction, results in the "quadriceps

avoidance" gait which leads to atrophy of the knee extensormuscles. In these situations it is not clear whether or not the atrophy is associated with loss of specific muscle fibre types with accompanying functional deficits. Such knowledge would be helpful in implementing exercise regimes designed to compensate for loss of particular fibre types. It is believed that isokinetic exercise performed at speeds below 180° per second strengthens type I muscle fibres, and type II fibres at fast speeds. However, there is no evidence to indicate the specific muscle fibre response to different rates of muscle contraction. Identification of muscle fibre type is most directly determined by biopsy technique but is too invasive for a routine measurement. Electromyography median

frequency has been used as a non-invasive measure to infer muscle fibre composition in various studies. However, the reliability and

accuracy of this technique has been questioned and improvement is necessary.



This research was designed to provide a more accurate and reliable protocol for the determination of EMG median frequency which may

be used, after validation against more direct biopsy techniques, as a routine method for inferring muscle fibre composition. The

investigation also explored the muscular response as measured by EMG median frequency to varying speeds of muscle contraction,

fatiguing exercise and atrophy following ACL reconstruction. The ultimate aim of this research was to improve the reliability of the

determination of EMG median frequency to enhance its application as a predictor of muscle fibre composition. This provides information which may improve ACL rehabilitation programs designed to restore and prevent specific muscle fibre types loss that have not previously been targeted by current rehabilitation programs. This research was conducted in three studies.



Study one determined the stability of the EMG median frequency bilaterally for the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles and identified the mode of contraction associated with the greatest

reliability. The strength and EMG median frequency of the vastus lateralis, medial hamstrings and vastus medialis of 55 subjects was

determined across 5 speeds from 0° to 240° per second using a Kin-Com isokinetic dynamometer and an EMG data acquisition system. Isometric contraction was found to have the least bilateral discrepancy (4.01% ±3.06) and between trials standard deviation (4.50) in the vastus lateralis, medial hamstrings and vastus medialis.



Study two investigated the EMG median frequency changes in the vastus lateralis which occur immediately following different speeds of isokinetic exercise to the point of fatigue in normal subjects. Thirty-four subjects participated in the study, and performed a 90-second period of isokinetic exercise to activate the knee extensors at either 30° or 300° per second. EMG median frequency of the vastus lateralis was determined before, immediately 

after and 7 minutes after the fatiguing exercise. The percentage drop in EMG median frequency of the vastus medialis was gnificantly (p<0.05) greater after slow speed (27.9%) than fast speed (20.25%) exercise, while no significant difference was found for the percentage drop in extension torque. Full recovery was found 7 minutes after the fatiguing exercise. By reference to previous research showing a relationship between EMG median

frequency and muscle fibre type, an increase in activation of type I muscle fibres with slow speed exercise and an increase in type II

muscle fibres with fast speed exercise was observed.



Study three identified the changes in EMG median frequency following ACL reconstruction and evaluated the bilateral differences in EMG median frequency of the knee muscles. The relationships between EMG median frequency and the measures of knee functional ability, knee muscle strength, age and time since surgery were also investigated. Twelve subjects who had undergone ACL reconstruction using a semitendinosus and gracilis graft 6 to 12

months earlier, participated in the study. EMG median frequency was determined from an 8-second isometric contraction and knee functional ability was assessed using the Cincinnati Rating Scale. Bilateral EMG median frequency shifts were inconsistent among subjects. On the basis of previous research which indicated a

relationship between EMG median frequency and fibre type, no consistent pattern of muscular fibre type atrophy subsequent to ACL reconstruction occurred within 6 to 12 months (ranged from -43 to 57 Hz). Additionally, no significant correlations were found between

the EMG median frequency and the knee functional score and knee extension and flexion torques, age, time since operation and the bilateral differences in EMG median frequency. The results of this investigation will serve to improve the reliability of EMG median frequency across a range of conditions in which it has been

evaluated. Further research is needed to confirm the relationship between EMG median frequency and direct observations of muscle fibre composition to improve the predictive value of this measure. Following this validation it will be possible to evaluate the bilateral EMG median frequency shift to infer the type of muscle fibre atrophy, and use this measure in determining the efficacy of specific rehabilitation programs.



In conclusion

* An 8-second isometric contraction is recommended for determining EMG median frequency.

* EMG median frequency of a muscle decreases significantly more after slow fatiguing exercise than after fast speed fatiguing exercise.

* There was no generalised bilateral EMG median frequency shift found in a group of subjects 6 to 12 months following semitendinosus and gracilis graft ACL reconstruction.

* The results of this study will serve to improve the reliability of procedures used to determine EMG median frequency under a range of different contractile conditions. The EMG median

frequency changes in response to these conditions require further validations with muscle biopsy in future.

TI  - Acute reconstruction results in less sick-leave days and as such fewer indirect costs to the individual and society compared to delayed reconstruction for ACL injuries.
PY  - 2019
AB  - To compare the total number of sick-leave days caused by the knee injury from the day of injury and over the first year between acute (within 8 days) and delayed (6–10 weeks) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and also assess other clinical outcomes during this period. Seventy patients with an acute ACL injury and Tegner level of 6 or more were randomized to acute (within 8 days) or delayed (after 6–10 weeks) ACLR. Patient-reported outcomes; objective IKDC and manual stability measurements were assessed at 6 and 12 months. With data from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (Forsakringskassan) information about the number of sick-leave days due to the knee injury over the following 12 months was collected and compared between the two groups. Seventy-one percent received compensation for sick leave (26 in the acute versus 23 in the delayed group). The mean number of sick-leave days for the acute group was significantly lower (M = 56.9, SD = 36.4) compared to the delayed group (M = 88.5, SD = 50.2), p < 0.05. The acute group was also significantly stronger in flexion in both slow and fast angle velocities according to Biodex®. No other differences were found between the groups in other clinical assessments or in terms of associated injuries. Acute and delayed ACLR provided comparable clinical outcomes after 12 months. Acute reconstruction resulted in less sick-leave days and as such fewer indirect costs to the individual and society. These findings suggest that if patients requiring ACLR can be identified early and ACLR can be performed in the acute phase, socioeconomic costs can potentially be reduced by minimizing time off work.

TI  - Return to sports activity after postoperative septic arthritis in ACL reconstruction.
PY  - 2010
AB  - AbstractBackground: Septic arthritis after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a rare but potentially serious complication. Several different options have been proposed to treat this condition. Our study aims to report the clinical, radiological, and sports activity results using our original protocol based on outpatient irrigation of the knee as well as parenteral and oral antibiotics. Methods: From January 2001 to January 2009, 14 patients (all active in sports) were treated for postoperative septic arthritis of the knee after ACL reconstruction in our institute. The treatment protocol included outpatient irrigation of the knee and parenteral antibiotics, followed by oral antibiotics. Repetitive irrigation was performed if necessary. The average follow-up period for our series was 38 months (range, 8–54 months). Follow-up included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) forms, radiographs, Tegner and Lysholm scores, and KT-1000™ arthrometric evaluation. Results: Tre...

TI  - Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: a clinical comparison of bone-patellar tendon-bone single bundle versus semitendinosus and gracilis double bundle technique
PY  - 2010
AB  - The study hypothesis was that the outcome of semitendinosus gracilis double bundle (STG-DB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is advantageous in terms of clinical results and restoration of anterior-posterior and rotational laxity in comparison to bone-patellar tendon-bone single-bundle (PTB-SB) ACL reconstruction. We analysed 41 PTB-SB and 51 STG-DB patients using the Tegner, IKDC and WOMAC scores preoperatively and at a minimum follow-up of two years. At follow-up, there was no significant difference in the clinical scores. The KT 1000 side-to-side measurement showed no significant difference between groups. The STG-DB group was significantly superior in terms of the pivot-shift sign and anterior knee pain. We conclude that the outcome of STG-DB reconstruction in the mid-term was not advantageous in terms of clinical scores and anterior-posterior laxity evaluated by the KT 1000. Nevertheless, the restored rotational laxity measured by the pivot shift test was significantly superior in the STG-DB technique.

TI  - Combined Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction Results in Better Knee Stability and More Satisfactory Subjective Outcomes in Non-Athlete Patients Undergoing Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <b>Background</b>: Consensus has not yet been reached regarding combined anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ALLR) with revisional anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (RACLR). We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes between patients who underwent isolated RACLR and those who underwent RACLR combined with ALLR. <b>Methods</b>: Between June 2010 and June 2021, 49 patients who underwent RACLR were retrospectively reviewed over a 24-month follow-up. Patients were categorized into the isolated RACLR (n = 37, group 1) or combined ALLR group (n = 12, group 2). Clinical outcomes were evaluated with several patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for each PROM. The side-to-side difference (SSD) of the anterior instability was measured. The pivot-shift test was performed. <b>Results</b>: Baseline characteristics showed no differences between the groups. PROMs showed no significant differences between the groups at the 2-year follow-up. Group 2 was superior to group 1 in the MCID achievement rate for Lysholm knee and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores at 24 months postoperatively. At the final follow-up, the proportion of IKDC grade A in SSD for anterior laxity was higher in group 2 than in group 1 (58.3% versus [vs.] 18.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.009), and the proportion of pivot-shift grade 0 was also higher in group 2 (66.7% vs. 27.0%, <i>p</i> = 0.013). The "near return to activity" rate was also higher in group 2 than in group 1 (83.3% vs. 45.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.043). <b>Conclusions</b>: Combining ALLR with RACLR in non-athletes results in a higher proportion of patients with less mechanical graft failure and satisfactory clinical outcomes.

TI  - Management of Articular Cartilage Defects in the Knee: An Evidence-Based Algorithm
PY  - 2024
AB  - <jats:p>Focal articular cartilage lesions of the knee are a challenging disease entity due to the poor regenerative properties of hyaline cartilage that often lead to degenerative joint disease. Surgery is indicated to alleviate symptoms, restore function, and return to desired activities when conservative treatment fails. Providers must consider defect size and severity, compliance with the postoperative rehabilitation protocol including weight-bearing restrictions, and patient expectations in their clinical decision-making. Smaller defects may be treated with arthroscopic chondroplasty, bone marrow stimulation, and osteochondral autologous transfer. Alternative surgical options for larger defects include osteochondral restoration using fresh vs. cryopreserved allografts, autologous chondrocyte implantation, and particulated juvenile allograft cartilage. This article will review available treatment options and provide an evidence-based treatment algorithm to guide the orthopaedic clinician's clinical decision-making.</jats:p>

TI  - Current clinical evidence for the use of mesenchymal stem cells in articular cartilage repair
PY  - 2016
AB  - ABSTRACTIntroduction: Articular cartilage is renowned for its poor intrinsic capacity for repair. Current treatments for osteoarthritis are limited in their ability to reliably restore the native articular cartilage structure and function. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) present an attractive treatment option for articular cartilage repair, with a recent expansion of clinical trials investigating their use in patients.Areas covered: This paper provides a current overview of the clinical evidence on the use of MSCs in articular cartilage repair.Expert opinion: The article demonstrates robust clinical evidence that MSCs have significant potential for the regeneration of hyaline articular cartilage in patients. The majority of clinical trials to date have yielded significantly positive results with minimal adverse effects. However the clinical research is still in its infancy. The optimum MSC source, cell concentrations, implantation technique, scaffold, growth factors and rehabilitation protocol for clinical ...

TI  - The Anterior Cruciate Ligament
PY  - 2014
AB  - The anterior cruciate ligament of the knee (ACL) is the most reconstructed ligament in the human body. Granan et al. gathered data from Denmark, Norway and Sweden as part of the Scandinavian registry. The overall annual incidence of primary ACL reconstructions ranged between 32 and 38 per 100,000 inhabitants. This rose to 71–91 for the target population (15–39). There was a slight predominance of males (57–60 %). The median age at injury was 23–27 and at surgery 25–30, with a median time from injury to surgery of 7–10 months. Soccer, handball and skiing were the top injuring sporting activities (13–50 %). The reconstruction averaged approximately 1 h and was predominantly performed as outpatient surgery (38–79 %). Simultaneous meniscal (35–55 %) and cartilage (17–27 %) lesions were common and led to less favorable outcomes. Meniscectomy was the most frequent procedure for meniscal injuries (69–80 %). Autologus hamstrings were the most used grafts (61–86 %), followed by bone – patellar tendon – bone (14–38 %). All knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome (KOOS) subscales improved up to 2 years postoperatively, with no difference between single and double bundle procedures. The highest increase was seen in function and sports, pledging for an injury of the young and physically active population [1–3].

TI  - Good Subjective Outcomes, Stable Knee and High Return to Sport after Tibial Eminence Avulsion Fracture in Children.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Avulsion fracture of the tibial spine (TSA) is uncommon in children, although its incidence is increasing with the earlier practice of competitive sport activities. This study aims to report mid to long term outcomes in children who sustained a TSA, with a special focus on a return to sport activities. Skeletally immature patients with a TSA, treated in two orthopedic hospitals, were evaluated for range of motion and knee laxity using KT1000, KiRA and Rolimeter. The pediatric International Knee Documentation Committee score (Pedi-IKDC) and the Hospital for Special Surgery pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (Pedi-FABS) questionnaires were recorded during the latest visit. Forty-two children were included. Twenty-six were treated nonoperatively and 16 underwent surgery. At a mean follow-up of 6.9 ± 3.6 years, 36 patients completed the questionnaires and 23 patients were tested with arthrometers. Among them, 96% had normal knee laxity. The Pedi-IKDC score averaged 96.4 ± 5.7 points, while the mean Pedi-FABS was 22.2 ± 5.9 points, without statistically significant differences between groups. Twenty-eight patients (78%) returned to their previous level of sport activity (eight amateur, 13 competitive, seven elite athletes). Eight patients (22%) quit sport, mostly because of re-injury fear. If properly treated, pediatric TSAs achieve a high rate of successful healing, with complete restoration of knee stability and an early return to sport activities.

TI  - Clinical Outcome Measures in Arthroscopic Meniscectomy: Clinician versus Patient Completed Knee Scores.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <b>Objective</b>  The aim of the present study was to investigate the difference between clinician-completed and patient-completed outcome scores in detecting improvement following arthroscopic meniscectomy in patients with meniscal tears of the knee. <b>Methods</b>  Thirty-four patients with meniscal tears were prospectively assessed using 9 clinical outcome measures. The five clinician-completed knee scores included the Tegner Activity Score, the Lysholm Knee Score, the Cincinnati Knee Score, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Examination Knee Score, and the Tapper and Hoover Meniscal Grading Score. The four patient-completed knee scores included the IKDC Subjective Knee Score, the Knee Outcome Survey - Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADLS), the Short Form-12 Item Health Survey (SF-12), and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Twenty-nine of the 34 patients underwent an arthroscopic meniscectomy and were reassessed with all 9 outcome scores upon their follow-up review. <b>Results</b>  A significant longitudinal improvement was observed in 4 of the 5 clinician-completed scores (Tegner [ <i>p</i>  < 0.001], Lysholm [ <i>p</i>  = 0.004], Cincinnati [p = 0.002] and Tapper and Hoover [ <i>p</i>  < 0.001], but not in the IKDC Examination [ <i>p</i>  = 0.332]. However, the IKDC Subjective score ( <i>p</i>  = 0.021) was the only patient-completed score to demonstrate significant improvement postoperatively. <b>Conclusion</b>  Overall, clinician-completed scoring systems were found to be inconsistent with those of patient-completed instruments. The mode of administering outcome measures can have a significant influence on the outcome results both for research and for clinical practice. A combination of both a clinician-completed with a patient-completed instrument may be a more balanced approach to assessing and quantifying meniscus tears and the outcome following arthroscopic meniscectomy.

TI  - High complication rate after biplanar open wedge high tibial osteotomy stabilized with a new spacer plate (Position HTO plate) without bone substitute.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose We performed a prospective clinical and radiographic evaluation after open wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO) using the new Position HTO plate (Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany) without bone transplantation. Methods Thirty-five open wedge HTOs with the Position HTO plate were performed without bone wedges. The mean patient age was 44.6 ± 9.2 years at the time of osteotomy, which was planned with mediCAD II software (Hectec, Niederviehbach, Germany). The Hospital for Special Surgery score, Lysholm-Gillquist score, Tegner activity level, and International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score were used for clinical assessment. We evaluated radiographs obtained preoperatively and at 2, 6, and 12 months postoperatively using full–weight-bearing anteroposterior whole-leg views and anteroposterior and lateral views of the knee. For statistical analyses, JMP 8.0.1 (SAS, Cary, NC) was used. Results We observed an overall complication rate of 34% and a plate-related complication rate of 23%. Plate-related complications included loss of correction, fracture of the tibial plateau, screw failure, malunion, and fracture of the lateral cortical bone. A significant difference in the mechanical tibiofemoral angle of −1.3° ± 1.4° ( P P P P P Conclusions We have shown a high plate-related complication rate and a significant loss of correction between 2 and 6 months of follow-up after open wedge HTO using the new Position HTO plate without bone wedges. The preoperatively planned mechanical tibiofemoral angle was not achieved. Despite these complications, the clinical outcome improved significantly. The Position HTO plate cannot be recommended with the presented technique. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Outcome of cartilage at 12 years of follow-up after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Introduction In cases of chronic anterior laxity, reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) can slow the development of osteoarthritis. This study was conducted to determine the overall prevalence of osteoarthritis and to identify the risk factors after ACL reconstruction. Hypothesis Meniscus tears, time from injury to surgery, body mass index (BMI), residual laxity, and cartilage lesions influence the progression towards osteoarthritis. Materials and methods This multicenter, retrospective study on the outcome of cruciate ligaments at 12 years of follow-up was conducted within the 2014 SOFCOT Symposium. The cohort included 675 arthroscopic reconstructions of the ACL from January 2002 to December 2003. The clinical evaluation included the objective and subjective IKDC score. Osteoarthritis was analyzed on 589 knee X-rays according to the IKDC classification. The predictive factors of osteoarthritis development studied were age, gender, BMI, time from injury to surgery, activity level, medial or lateral meniscectomy, type of graft, medial or lateral chondropathy, tunnel positioning, and residual laxity. Univariate and multivariate analyses with logistic regression were performed. Results The mean follow-up was 11.9 ± 0.8 years. The subjective IKDC score was 83.7 ± 13. At 12 years, the rate of moderate to severe osteoarthritis l (IKDC C or D) was 19% (16% medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis, 4% lateral tibiofemoral osteoarthritis, and 2% patellofemoral osteoarthritis). The prognostic factors were age at surgery greater than 34 years ( P P P P Conclusions This large-scale study identified risk factors for osteoarthritis that should improve the information provided to patients on long-term progression after ACL reconstruction. Level of evidence Retrospective cohort study, level IV.

TI  - Anteromedial portal versus transtibial drilling techniques in ACL reconstruction: a blinded cross-sectional study at two- to five-year follow-up
PY  - 2010
AB  - Drilling of the femoral tunnel with the transtibial (TT) technique is widely used in bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Recent studies suggest higher knee stability with the use of the anteromedial portal (AMP). The purpose of this study was to compare functional and clinical outcomes of BPTB ACL reconstruction using the TT or the AMP technique for drilling the femoral tunnel. All ACL reconstructions between January 2003 and April 2006 were approached for eligibility. Forty-seven patients met inclusion criteria (21 TT group and 26 AMP group). Blinded assessments of IKDC score, knee stability and range of motion, one-leg hop test, mid-quadriceps circumference, VAS for satisfaction with surgery, Lysholm and Tegner scores, and SF-12 questionnaire were obtained for both groups. Data on preoperative and postoperative surgical timing were retrospectively reviewed through the charts. The AMP group demonstrated a significantly lower recovery time from surgery to walking without crutches (p < 0.01), to return to normal life (p < 0.03), to return jogging (p < 0.03), to return training (p < 0.03), and to return to play (p < 0.03). Knee stability values measured with KT-1000, Lachman test, pivot-shift sign, and objective IKDC score assessments were significantly better for the AMP compared to TT group (p < 0.002, p < 0.03, p < 0.02, p < 0.015, respectively). No differences were found for VAS for satisfaction with surgery, Lysholm, Tegner, and SF-12 between both groups. The use of the AMP technique significantly improved the anterior-posterior and rotational knee stability, IKDC scores, and recovery time from surgery compared to the TT technique.

TI  - Rate of force development as an adjunctive outcome measure for return-to-sport decisions after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2012
AB  - Study Design Descriptive, prospective, longitudinal single-cohort study. Objective To investigate the rate of force development to 30% (RFD30), 50% (RFD50), and 90% (RFD90) of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) as an adjunct outcome measure for determining readiness for return to sport following an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Background One criterion of full recovery following an ACL reconstruction is the ability to achieve 85% or 90% of the maximal strength of the contralateral limb. However, the time required to develop muscular strength in many types of daily and sports activities is considerably shorter than that required to achieve maximal strength. Therefore, in addition to maximal strength, neuromuscular functions such as RFD should also be considered in the definition of recovery. Methods Forty-five male professional soccer players who underwent an ACL reconstruction were recruited. Assessment with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Kn...

TI  - Anteromedial Portal Versus Transtibial Drilling Techniques in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Any Clinical Relevance? A Retrospective Comparative Study
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose This study aimed to undertake a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data comparing, at a minimum follow-up of 5 years (78.1 ± 5.3 months v 75.6 ± 4.8 months), the clinical, functional, and radiographic outcomes of 2 homogeneous groups of athletes who had undergone arthroscopic single-bundle autologous hamstring reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) using a transtibial (TT) or an anteromedial portal (AMP) approach to drill the femoral tunnel. Methods Ninety-four patients were operated on in 2005 and 2006, and 88 (93.6%) (73 men, 15 women) were evaluated subjectively and objectively, using the Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, manual maximum displacement test with a KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) and the Lachman test, and rotational instability with the pivot shift test. Degenerative changes were assessed on radiographs according to the Fairbank classification. Results The median age at operation was 29 years (20 to 43 years; SD, 5.4) in the TT group 1 and 28 years (19 to 45 years; SD, 6.1) in the AMP group 2. At the last appointment, the 2 groups had similar results for the Lysholm and IKDC scores (primary outcome). Patients who underwent the AMP approach had less glide pivot shift ( P  = .42) and Lachman ( P  = .47) phenomena, with no statistically significant intergroup difference. Radiography showed fewer, but not significantly different, degenerative changes in the AMP ACL reconstruction group at final follow-up ( P  = .47). Conclusions In our series, ACL reconstruction using a femoral tunnel drilled through an AMP provided better rotational stability and anterior translation than drilling the femoral tunnel using the TT technique. This difference likely is not relevant from a clinical and functional viewpoint. The 2 groups of patients were not significantly different in terms of development of degenerative changes seen radiographically at a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative study.

TI  - Arthroscopic Reconstruction of the Posterior Cruciate Ligament With Use of a Quadruple Hamstring Tendon Graft With 3- to 5-Year Follow-up
PY  - 2006
AB  - Purpose: This study prospectively evaluated 20 patients treated consecutively to determine patient outcomes, efficacy, and complication potential of arthroscopically assisted posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction performed with hamstring tendon grafts. Methods: Twenty patients (15 men and 5 women), each with an isolated PCL injury, underwent PCL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autograft and were enrolled in this prospective study. Average age at time of surgery was 29 years (range, 20 to 57 years). Average time from injury to surgery was 4 months (range, 3 to 12 months). Average follow-up period was 40 months (range, 36 to 50 months). Patients underwent regular follow-up after clinical and radiographic preoperative and postoperative evaluation. Follow-up examinations comprised the Lysholm Knee Score, the Tegner Activity Score, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, thigh muscle assessment, and radiographic evaluation. Results: Mean preoperative Lysholm score for 20 knees was 63 ± 10 (range, 48-73); mean postoperative Lysholm score was 93 ± 9 (range, 77-100). Eighteen of 20 patients (90%) showed good or excellent results at final assessment. Mean preinjury and preoperative Tegner scores were 7 ± 1.5 (range, 5-9) and 3 ± 1.9 (range, 2-5), respectively; mean postoperative Tegner score for 20 knees was 6.3 ± 2.4 (range, 4-9). In final IKDC ratings, 85% of patients (17 of 20) were assessed as normal or near normal (grade A or B). A statistically significant improvement was seen in thigh girth difference, extensor strength ratio, and flexor strength ratio before and after reconstruction at a minimum of 3 years of follow-up. Conclusions: After follow-up for longer than 36 months, analytical results showed satisfactory function after PCL reconstruction with the use of hamstring tendon autografts. We suggest that the hamstring tendon autograft is a safe, effective, and acceptable choice for PCL reconstruction, and that it affords good ligament reconstruction. Level of Evidence: IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Micro‑scale assessment of the postoperative effect of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction preclinical study using a 7.1T micro‑magnetic resonance imaging
PY  - 2018
AB  - High-field micro-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning may provide additional information for quantitative analysis of graft bone healing processes, thus serving as a promising supplementary method in graft and bone healing evaluation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgery during preclinical studies. The present study included 12 New Zealand white rabbits that underwent ACLR with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) ligament. At 4, 8, and 16 weeks following surgery, 4 rabbits were euthanized and knee joint samples were harvested for a 7.1T micro-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The graft bone tunnel diameter and signal noise ratio (SNR) at the region of interest (ROI) were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed at each time point to verify the graft bone healing process in histology. The bone tunnel diameter at the graft tunnel interface decreased over time in both femoral and tibial parts. Notably, the tunnel size was smaller than the diameter of the drilling Kirschner wire that was used to observe the femoral part and proximal site of the tibial part at 16 weeks following surgery. SNR research demonstrated that both the femoral and tibial part PET ligaments selected in the ROI exhibited a marked increase in SNR from the initial 4-week results. The micro-MRI result was consistent with that of histological analysis. Micro-MRI scanning was applied in an animal model that underwent ACL reconstruction surgery with PET ligament, and it was determined that micro-MRI is promising in quantitatively observing graft bone healing processes directly with a focus on graft tunnel distances and SNRs.

TI  - [Translated article] Psychological readiness to return to sports after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in amateur sport
PY  - 2022
AB  - Return to sports (RTS) is maybe the main expectation for the patient after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The aim of this study was to analyze the psychological readiness to RTS in a cohort of amateur sports after ACLR.Retrospective study of a prospective database of patients treated with ACLR performed between January and December 2017. Psychological readiness to RTS after ACLR was evaluated with the short version of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scale.A total of 43 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was 24.7 years. The mean follow-up was 32.5 months. All patients practiced any type of sports at final follow-up. The mean ACL-RSI score was 71.5. Fear of reinjury was mentioned by 14 patients (32.5%). Twenty-four patients (55.8%) pointed out that they did not practice sport at the pre-injury level. The mean ACL-RSI score was statistically significant lower in this group of patients (59.7 vs 87.3; p<.001).Fear of reinjury keeps after ACLR. Patients that they did not practice sport at the pre-injury level show lower scores in ACL-RSI for RTS.

TI  - High Rate of Overlapping Question Content Among Commonly Used Patient-Reported Outcome Measurements for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury
PY  - 2021
AB  - Purpose To precisely compare the questions and content between the most commonly cited knee-specific patient-reported outcome measurements (PROs) for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Methods A literature review through Medline from November 1, 2018, to November 1, 2020, was performed to find the most cited knee-specific PROs for assessment of ACL injuries. Each question was then classified as 1) identical, similar, or unique; 2) pertaining to 1 of 6 domains (pain, symptoms, functional activities, occupational activities, sports/recreation, and quality of life). The PROs were then compared to each other to assess question overlap and domain coverage. Results A total of 133 questions were analyzed from the seven most common PROs: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, Tegner Activity Scale, Marx Scale, Knee Outcome Survey (KOS), and Cincinnati Knee Rating System (CKRS). The total distribution of identical (31.6%), similar (31.6%), and unique (36.8%) questions was found to be relatively even. However, this distribution varied within each PRO. KOS and Lysholm had the highest percentages of identical questions (64% and 62.5%, respectively). KOOS had the highest number of unique questions (26/42, 61.9%), while Tegner held the highest percentage (11/16, 68.8%). Sports/recreation was the only domain assessed by all PROs. Conclusion Nearly two-thirds of questions overlap between the commonly used PROs for ACL injury. Although sports/recreation is assessed by all PROs, each has its own pattern of coverage across this and other domains. Level of Evidence IV, cross-sectional study.

TI  - Similar functional outcomes of arthroscopic reconstruction in patients with isolated Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) and combined Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) and PCL tears.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Background Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) injuries seldom occur in isolation and majority occurs in conjugation with other ligament injuries. Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) reconstruction continues to be taken into consideration as a complicated surgical procedure, with heterogeneity in literature regarding clinical and functional outcomes in isolated PCL and combined ACL and PCL injuries. Methods The retrospective evaluation of patients with isolated PCL reconstruction (group 1) and combined Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) and PCL reconstruction (group 2) was performed. A total of 66 patients with either isolated PCL or combined ACL and PCL reconstruction surgeries that met the inclusion criteria, were included in the study. These patients were assessed for functional outcome scores including Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Tegner activity score at a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Results The mean follow-up of patients was 82.09 ± 12.43 months in group 1 and 79.36 ± 11.24 months in group 2, with a total of 29 patients in group 1 and 21 patients in group 2. Both the groups were found to be comparable in terms of age, gender, duration of injury and pre-injury Tegner activity level. Post-surgical functional outcome scores (WOMAC score, Lysholm score and Tegner score) were found to be comparable between 2 groups at a mean follow-up of 5 years. Further, 22 patients in group 1 and 16 patients in group 2 had normal or near normal objective IKDC outcome scores at a mean follow-up of 5 years. Conclusions No differences were observed in functional outcome scores (WOMAC score, Lysholm score, Tegner score and IKDC score) between isolated reconstructed PCL and combined ACL and PCL reconstructed patients.

TI  - FIXATION OF TIBIAL AVULSION FRACTURES OF THE POSTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT USING PULL THROUGH SUTURE AND MALLEOLAR SCREW
PY  - 2007
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tibial avulsion fractures of the posterior cruciate ligament are not infrequent. However, controversies exist between the fixation of the fragments and their reconstruction in the cases with small bony fragments. This prospective study was undertaken to study the results after fixation of the fragments by the malleolar screw and the pull through suture techniques. METHODS: From June 2003 to March 2005, 26 patients with acute isolated posterior cruciate ligament avulsion fracture of the tibial attachment were treated surgically at Qhaem and Emam Reza hospitals at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. The screw fixation was used in 18 cases with large bony fragments and the suturing method for other cases who had small or comminuted fragments. The patients were followed for an average of 14 months; and according to The International Knee Documentation Committee the results were evaluated.

TI  - Use of Inertial Sensors for Quantifying the Pivot Shift Maneuver
PY  - 2016
AB  - There is emerging interest in the use of inertial sensors such as gyroscopes and accelerometers in evaluating rotational instability of the knee. In particular, a number of groups have recently investigated the use of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors in instrumenting the pivot shift examination. Using such sensors, it has been demonstrated that an injured knee subjected to the exam tends to undergo larger accelerations than its normal counterpart. Further, higher pivot shift scores (Benjaminse et al. Orthop Phys Ther 36(5):267–288, 2006; Berruto et al. Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc 21(4):981–985, 2013) are typically associated with elevated accelerations. Diagnosis of ACL rupture or other quantifications of ACL state based on thresholding of such sensor data does not provide sufficient accuracy for clinical use. However, application of advanced classification techniques to such data has yielded large improvements in diagnostic accuracy.

               <jats:p>
                  <jats:italic>Study aim</jats:italic>: to examine the differences in landing kinetics factors (LKF) to assess the whole body stability and preparatory muscle activation (PMA) in female handball players with and without dynamic knee valgus.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>
                  <jats:italic>Material and methods</jats:italic>: Twenty-four professional female handball players (11 with (DKV) and 13 without (Control) dynamic knee valgus) were asked to perform three trials of a single-leg landing. LKF and surface EMG were recorded. Initial contact knee valgus angle (IC KVA), vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), confidence ellipse area of center of pressure (CEA), time to stability (TTS) and EMG from 100 ms prior to ground contact were used in the data analyses.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>
                  <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>: Multivariate analyzing of LKF showed significant differences between two groups (p = 0.001) while for PMA the result was not significant (p = 0.361).</jats:p>

TI  - Arthroscopic lateral discoid meniscectomy. Case discussion and review of literature
PY  - 2008
AB  - Discoid meniscus is a morphological anomaly which was described for the first time in the late nineteenth century. It is most commonly found on the lateral aspect of the knee and can be associated with significant morbidity. With the advent of arthroscopic surgical management, either partial or sub-total meniscectomy (depending upon the type of the anomaly) is replacing older techniques. We present our experience with four cases of discoid meniscus treated with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy.

TI  - A prospective randomized comparison of bone-patellar tendon-bone and hamstring grafts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the results after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using central-third, bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB group), 3-strand semitendinosus (ST group), or 4-strand semitendinosus/gracilis (ST/G group) autografts. Type of study: Prospective randomized trial. Methods: A randomized series of 134 patients, all with unilateral ACL rupture was included in the study. In all 3 groups, interference screw fixation of the graft was used at both ends and 125 of 134 (93%) of the patients returned for the follow-up examination after 26 months (range, 20 to 43 months). The preoperative assessments in all 3 groups were similar in terms of gender, Tegner activity level, Lysholm score, KT-1000 measurements, 1-leg hop test, and the knee-walking test. Results: At follow-up, the knee-walking test was significantly worse in the BPTB group than in the ST group ( P = .0004) and ST/G group ( P P Conclusions: Two years after ACL reconstruction, the use of ST and ST/G autografts rendered significantly less discomfort during the knee-walking test than the use of BPTB autografts. However, in terms of functional outcome and knee laxity, the groups displayed no significant differences. Level of evidence: Level I.

TI  - Trochleoplasty as a Solitary Treatment for Recurrent Patellar Dislocation Results in Good Clinical Outcome in Adolescents
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background:The essential static patellar stabilizer is a normal-shaped trochlear groove. A dysplastic groove destabilizes the patella. Trochleoplasty approaches this underlying condition and reshapes the trochlea. However, studies have reported on trochleoplasty for revision cases or as accompanied by other interventions. The effect of trochleoplasty alone remains unexplained.Purpose:To introduce trochleoplasty as a stand-alone treatment for recurrent patellar dislocation and to compare its pre- to postoperative functional and clinical variables.Study Design:Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Methods:A trochleoplasty was performed in 50 knees (27 right) in 44 patients (30 females; mean ± SD age, 15.6 ± 2.0 years). The indication for surgery was recurrent patellar dislocation not responding to nonoperative treatment (>6 months), with types B through D dysplasia and closed or closing physes in adolescents aged 10 to 20 years.

TI  - Clinical, Functional, and Physical Activity Outcomes 5 Years Following the Treatment Algorithm of the Delaware-Oslo ACL Cohort Study.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries can be treated with or without ACL reconstruction (ACLR), and more high-quality studies evaluating outcomes after the different treatment courses are needed. The purpose of the present study was to describe and compare 5-year clinical, functional, and physical activity outcomes for patients who followed our decision-making and treatment algorithm and chose (1) early ACLR with preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation, (2) delayed ACLR with preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation, or (3) progressive rehabilitation alone. Early ACLR was defined as that performed ≤6 months after the preoperative rehabilitation program, and late ACLR was defined as that performed >6 months after the preoperative rehabilitation program. Methods We included 276 patients from a prospective cohort study. The patients had been active in jumping, pivoting, and cutting sports before the injury and sustained a unilateral ACL injury without substantial concomitant knee injuries. The patients chose their treatment through a shared decision-making process. At 5 years, we assessed the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Marx Activity Rating Scale, sports participation, quadriceps muscle strength, single-legged hop performance, and new ipsilateral and contralateral knee injuries. Results The 5-year follow-up rate was 80%. At 5 years, 64% of the patients had undergone early ACLR, 11% had undergone delayed ACLR, and 25% had had progressive rehabilitation alone. Understandably, the choices that participants made differed by age, concomitant injuries, symptoms, and predominantly level-I versus level-II preinjury activity level. There were no significant differences in any clinical, functional, or physical activity outcomes among the treatment groups. Across treatment groups, 95% to 100% of patients were still active in some kind of sports and 65% to 88% had IKDC-SKF and KOOS scores above the threshold for a patient acceptable symptom state. Conclusions Patients with ACL injury who were active in jumping, pivoting, and cutting sports prior to injury; who had no substantial concomitant knee injuries; and who followed our decision-making and treatment algorithm had good 5-year knee function and high sport participation rates. Three of 4 patients had undergone ACLR within 5 years. There were no significant differences in any outcomes among patients treated with early ACLR, delayed ACLR, or progressive rehabilitation alone. Level of evidence Therapeutic Level II. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Italian version of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form: cross-cultural adaptation and validation.
PY  - 2004
AB  - Purpose: Patient-oriented measures, represented by self-administered questionnaires, have become an important aspect of clinical outcome assessment. To be used with different language groups and in different countries, questionnaires must be translated and adapted to new cultural characteristics, and then validated by a widely accepted process to evaluate reliability and validity, fundamental characteristics for each measure. The aim of the study was to perform the cross-cultural adaptation and to assess the reliability and validity of the Italian version of the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form. Type of Study: A cross-cultural adaptation and cross-sectional study of a sample of patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with a subsample followed up prospectively for retest reliability. Methods: The IKDC Subjective Knee Form was culturally adapted for Italian-speaking people, following the simplified Guillemin criteria. Reliability and validity were assessed in a cross-sectional study of 50 consecutive patients undergoing ACL reconstruction. A subsample of 20 patients was followed up prospectively for retest reliability. Results: The results were compared with other validated patient-oriented measures. The principal IKDC scale showed a high correlation with other patient-oriented measures as hypothesized, and it also showed good values with regard to reproducibility, consistency, and validity, compared with the versions of IKDC published in other languages. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the evaluation capacities of the IKDC Italian version are equivalent to those of other language versions of the IKDC. Level of Evidence: Level II.

Patients who had suffered knee dislocations III to V (KD III-KD V) (28 KD III, 16 KD IV, and 3 KD V injuries) between July 2006 and May 2014 were treated using a standard protocol of surgical treatment within 3 weeks of injury followed by early postoperative range of motion.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Treatment:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The treatment consisted of open primary repair [21/42 (50%), anterior cruciate ligament; 36/43 (83%), posterior cruciate ligament; 26/27 (92%), lateral cruciate ligament; 17/18 (96%), posterolateral corner] or allograft reconstruction with early range of motion.</jats:p>

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Main Outcome Measurements:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The main outcome measurements were infection, range of motion, International Knee Documentation Committee, and Tegner and Lysholm scores at 12 months after surgery.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>No patient had a postoperative deep wound infection requiring surgery. Two patients had a superficial infection that required oral antibiotics only. The average extension was 0 degrees. All but 1 patient achieved full extension; the patient developed a 5-degree flexion contracture. Mean active range of motion at 6 and 12 months was a mean arc of 119 and 123 degrees, respectively. Anterior tibiofemoral translation of &gt;5 mm measured with KT-1000 was present in 6 (13%) patients. Six of the 47 patients (13%) had circumferential avulsions, and 1 patient with a poor subjective outcome had a concomitant complete patellar tendon avulsion in the setting of an open dislocation. One patient (2%) had laxity and instability requiring revision arthroscopic reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament and manipulation under anesthesia, and 3 patients required manipulation under anesthesia or open lysis because of stiffness.</jats:p>
            <jats:p>Fifteen (32%) patients reported knee function between 7 and 10 (competitive or higher) on the Tegner activity level scale. The mean International Knee Documentation Committee ±SD scores were 53.3±26.7 (range, 8 to 97.7) with 16/47 (34%) knees found to be normal, 13/47 (27.6%) near normal, 13 (27.6%) abnormal, and 5 (10.6%) severely abnormal. The mean Lysholm knee score was 75.4±22.1 (range, 25 to 98). No patient in the study had rotational instability at final follow-up with clinical assessment of posteromedial or posterolateral rotation (Dial test).</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Open operative treatment within the first 3 weeks of injury with primary repair or reconstruction of all injured structures can yield outcomes similar to those reported in patients treated with delayed or staged reconstruction of ligaments. Early treatment allows definitive management of injuries that are difficult to address on a delayed basis. Complications of infection, revision because of laxity, and stiffness are uncommon with this approach.</jats:p>

TI  - A minimally invasive surgical technique for augmented reconstruction of the lateral ankle ligaments with woven polyester tape.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Although stabilization of the lateral ankle ligament complex (LALC) with augmented techniques is known to be successful, it is associated with a number of complications. We hypothesize that successful stabilization of LALC can be achieved with a woven polyester tape implant via a minimally invasive procedure, as an alternative to tenodesis. Four men with chronic instability of the ankle underwent a minimally invasive surgical stabilization of LALC with a woven polyester tape. This tape was passed through the distal fibula to the base of the fifth metatarsal and then back to the fibula once more before being tied. The foot was immobilized in a neutral position for 2 weeks. Partial weightbearing with a walking stick began on the same day, and physiotherapy began for 10 weeks. Evaluation was performed at a mean follow-up of 24.5 months postoperatively. Preoperatively, all patients had a chronically unstable index ankle both functionally and clinically. At a mean of 24.5 months postoperatively, functional stability for all patients was normal (Sefton grade 1). Subjective ankle performance grades were normal in all cases, and all patients felt the outcome was excellent. Objective measurement with clinical stress testing showed anterior drawer and inversion tests to be the same as the contralateral ankle in all patients. However, each displayed limited inversion of the ankle. No complications such as wound dehiscence, infection, pain, or nerve injury were observed after the procedure. All were able to return to their preinjury activity level within 3 months. Stabilization of LALC may be simply and successfully achieved with a woven polyester graft as an alternative to tenodesis.

          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase to identify comparative studies directly comparing outcomes of primary ACLR with autograft versus nonirradiated allograft with a minimum 2-year follow-up. The search terms used were: "anterior cruciate ligament" AND autograft AND allograft AND (irradiation OR non-irradiated). Patients were evaluated based on graft failure rates, the Objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, anteroposterior laxity, and patient-reported outcomes (Subjective IKDC score, the visual analog scale [VAS], the Cincinnati Knee Rating System, Lysholm, and Tegner scores). Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I and Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool for non-randomized and randomized studies, respectively.</AbstractText>

TI  - Discoid Lateral Meniscus.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Partial and total meniscectomies are the most common treatments for patients with discoid lateral meniscus (DLM). We conducted this study to quantitatively assess and compare the outcomes of partial and total meniscectomies for DLM. We also assessed whether the outcomes differed by the type of DLM, duration of follow-up, and age of patients. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database to identify relevant studies that reported outcomes, including Ikeuchi grade, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee score, Lysholm score, or failure rate, in patients who underwent partial and total meniscectomies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, whereas mean difference and 95% CIs were calculated for continuous outcomes. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall rate of excellent (E) or good (G) postoperatively was 85.5% (95% CI: 79.5–91.5%). The E or G rate of partial meniscectomy was significantly higher than that of total meniscectomy (OR= 1.97, 95% CI: 1.03–3.75, p = 0.038). Besides, patients younger than 20 years had a significantly higher E or G rate than those older than 20 years. (OR = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.18–8.23, p = 0.022). We also found the E or G rate tended to decrease from short- to long-term follow-up. Our systematic review and meta-analysis showed that that partial meniscectomy could achieve better outcomes compared with total meniscectomy for DLM patients.

TI  - Single Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament With Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction Yields Similar Clinical and Radiographic Results at Minimum 2-Year Follow-Up Versus Double Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">To compare the clinical, radiographic, and second-look arthroscopic outcomes between double-bundle (DB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (DB group) and combined single-bundle (SB) ACL and anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction (SB + ALL group) by a prospective randomized controlled trial.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">From May 2019 to June 2020, 84 patients were enrolled in this study. Among them, 10 were lost to follow-up. Thirty-six and 38 patients were successfully allocated to the DB (mean follow up 27.3 ± 4.2 months) and SB + ALL groups (27.2 ± 4.5 months), respectively. The preoperative and postoperative Lachman test, pivot shift test, anterior translation on stress radiographs, KT-2000 arthrometer, Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, and Tegner activity score were evaluated and compared. Graft continuity was evaluated using postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (32 and 36 patients underwent MRI in the DB and SB + ALL groups at 7.4 ± 3.2 and 7.5 ± 2.9 months after surgery, respectively), and second-look examinations (second-look examination and tibial screw removal were performed concomitantly when patients (1) had tibial screw-related irritation or (2) needed the screws removed, 28 and 23 patients underwent examinations in the DB and SB + ALL groups at 24.0 ± 6.8 and 24.9 ± 8.1 months after surgery, respectively). All measurements were compared between the groups.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Postoperative clinical outcomes significantly improved in both groups. (All variables showed P &lt; .001) No statistically different outcomes were found between the 2 groups. Additionally, postoperative graft continuity on MRI and second-look examinations were not different between the 2 groups.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">The DB and SB + ALL groups showed similar postoperative clinical, radiographic, and second-look arthroscopic outcomes. Both groups showed excellent postoperative stability and clinical outcomes compared with the preoperative measurements.</AbstractText>

TI  - Association Between Early Postoperative Graft Signal Intensity and Residual Knee Laxity After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) graft signal intensity is associated with graft damage after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, little is known about the relationship between graft signal intensity and residual laxity of the reconstructed knee based on patient age.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Purpose/Hypothesis" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To evaluate the relationship between graft signal intensity and residual laxity in younger and older patients who underwent ACLR. We hypothesized that higher graft signal intensity would be associated with reduced postoperative knee stability.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Study Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 192 patients who underwent double-bundle ACLR were recruited. Proton density-weighted and T2-weighted MRI was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, and the signal intensity ratio (SIR) of the anteromedial and posterolateral bundles was measured as the graft signal intensity reference values. At 12 months after surgery, if the KT-1000 arthrometer measurement exhibited a side-to-side difference of ≥2 mm, the patient was determined as having anterior knee laxity. Rotatory knee laxity was defined as a positive pivot shift with International Knee Documentation Committee grade ≥1. The Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test was used to compare the SIR in patients with and without residual laxity. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationship between demographic parameters and the SIR. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal SIR cutoff values to predict residual laxity were calculated, and logistic regression analysis was conducted.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Of 192 patients, 26 (13.5%) had anterior knee laxity, and 20 (10.4%) had rotatory knee laxity. The SIR was negatively correlated with age. In younger patients (&lt;30 years; n = 135), those with residual laxity had a significantly higher SIR than those without laxity; this relationship was not significant in older patients (≥30 years; n = 57). Based on receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic regression analysis, the cutoff values that were determined for the SIR were significantly associated with a higher odds ratio of residual laxity.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Graft signal intensity decreased with patient age. Patients with higher graft signal intensity in the early postoperative phase after ACLR exhibited a higher prevalence of residual laxity, particularly in younger patients.</AbstractText>

TI  - A Novel Technique for Posterior Cruciate Ligament Tibial Avulsion Fixation through the Burks and Schaffer Approach
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Introduction:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Numerous techniques for the treatment of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) avulsion fractures have been described in literature from closed reduction to definitive fixation, both open and arthroscopically assisted fixation.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Aim:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>In this study, we evaluated the clinical and functional outcome after open reduction and internal fixation of tibial avulsion injuries of the PCL using number 5 polyester sutures (Ethicon-Ethibond excel) with Titanium AL (Tit) endobutton (Nebula Surgicals Private Limited, India) through burks and Schaffer posteromedial approach.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Materials and Methods:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>It was a prospective study of 22 patients of PCL tibial avulsion fractures; fixed using number 5 polyester sutures with Tit endobutton through burks and Schaffer approach with the patient in the prone position. We included only those patients who had isolated PCL avulsion injuries and came within 12 weeks of injury. The final functional outcome was compared using the Lysholm knee scoring system. Student's <jats:italic toggle="yes">t</jats:italic>-tests were used for intergroup comparison of Lysholm knee scores before and after surgery.</jats:p>

            <jats:title>Results:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The mean follow-up was of 11.9 months, with the loss of two patients in follow-up. Bony union was achieved in all patients within 8–15 weeks (mean-11.6 weeks). The average flexion of 122.8° with full extension achieved in all patients. Slight instability (1+) was noted in four patients. The Lysholm functional score was excellent in 16 patients and good in four patients with an average score of 94.6 ± 4.6.</jats:p>

TI  - Effects of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury on postural control and muscle activity of head, neck and trunk muscles.
PY  - 2006
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects that an anterior cruciate ligament injury of the knee has on postural control and activity of neck, head and trunk muscles to investigate the existence of connections between the masticatory system and body posture. Surface electromyographic activity of the muscles at mandibular rest position, and during maximal voluntary clenching and posturometric and stabilometric measurements of 25 adult patients having pathology on the left knee were compared with a control non-pathological group. At rest, the patients showed a higher muscular activity of anterior temporalis, masseter, sternocleidomastoid and lower trapezius, compared with the control subjects (P < 0.05). At maximal voluntary clenching, the patients showed a lower muscular activity of the right anterior temporalis and masseter and a higher muscular activity of the lower trapezius, compared with the control subjects. For the stabilometric measurements, all the subjects showed a significant reduction in the postural centre of pressure path length during the test with eyes open and cotton rolls, compared with the test with eyes closed and mandibular rest position (P < 0.05). In addition, the patients showed a significant displacement of the postural centre of pressure in a forward direction (P < 0.05) and into the right side (P < 0.05), compared with the control subjects. Anterior cruciate ligament injury appears to be associated to a change in the activity of head, neck and trunk muscles and to a change in the position of the postural centre of pressure. Cotton rolls seem to improve the stability of the subject.

PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Controversy exists regarding the origin of femoral torsion, and specific treatment rules regarding the optimal position of femoral osteotomy in patients with recurrent patellar subluxation and excessive femoral torsion are scarce.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To establish a novel classification system for such patients, and to compare clinical and radiological outcomes after distal derotational femoral osteotomy (DDFO) between femoral torsion at proximal (neck and shaft) and distal levels.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Between January 2014 and June 2019, patients who underwent DDFO were retrospectively reviewed. The segmental torsion analysis was performed to establish a novel classification system, and classify included patients into two groups: 35 patients in proximal torsion group and 38 patients in distal torsion group. These patients were followed-up for at least 3 years. Clinical evaluations included functional outcomes, physical examinations, quality of life, activity level, satisfaction, and complications. Radiological outcomes included patellofemoral osteoarthritis, congruence, and alignment.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Type I was defined as the proximal torsion. Type II was defined as the distal torsion. Proximal torsion group had lower postoperative femoral torsion (12.6 ± 2.6° vs. 14.8 ± 3.6°; P = .004) and higher surgical correction angle (21.6 ± 5.0° vs. 19.1 ± 3.0°; P = .009). All clinical and radiological outcomes improved significantly in both groups, but proximal torsion group had significantly higher quality of life (EQ-5D-5L: 0.96 ± 0.06 vs. 0.91 ± 0.07; P = .003.</AbstractText>

TI  - The effect of anterior cruciate ligament trauma and bracing on knee proprioception.
PY  - 1999
AB  - We studied the effect that chronic anterior cruciate ligament disruption, functional bracing, and a neoprene sleeve have on knee proprioception by measuring the threshold to detection of passive knee motion in all three conditions. The threshold to detection of passive knee motion was worse in knees with chronic anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency when compared with uninjured knees. This difference was small, on average an additional 0.28° of flexion-extension rotation was required for the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee before the subject detected motion, and of questionable significance from a clinical and functional perspective. Wearing a functional brace or neoprene sleeve on the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee did not significantly change the threshold to detection of passive motion in comparison with the same knee without a brace, although improvements were observed.

TI  - CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF ARTHROSCOPIC OSTEOCHONDRAL AUTOGRAFT TRANSFER (MOSAICPLASTY) FOR CARTILAGE DEFECTS OF THE KNEE
PY  - 2010
AB  - *** Farshad Safdari, MSc Abstract Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional outcome of arthroscopic treatment of chondral and osteochondral lesions of the knee with arthroscopic osteochondral autograft transfer (Mosaicplasty), and to evaluate the factors affecting the treatment outcome. Methods: In a before and after clinical trial, 56 patients with grade 4 full thickness chondral lesion (outer bridge classification) were treated by the arthroscopic mosaicplasty technique over a 4-year period at an hospital in Tehran, Iran. The mean time of follow-up was 21±4 months (16-32 months). The patients were assessed by International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lyshom knee scoring scale (LKSS). The impact of age, site of chondral lesion (medial or lateral femoral condyle), extent of the lesion (number of plugs) and associated lesions, preoperative active levels, tourniquet time and surgery complications were studied. In 3 cases, second-look arthroscopy was performed. Results: The result of 78.6% was excellent and 21.4 good, based on IKDC. Preoperative Lysholm score was 67.1±17.6 and postoperative score increased to 93.2±6.5 (p=.0004). Clinical outcomes were better significantly in patients with associated articular lesions, lateral condyles lesions, professional athletes and younger patients, also in cases with lower plug numbers and sport injuries (p<.05). Early postoperative complication was seen in 2 patients who were improved with proper treatment. Conclusion: The results show autogenous osteochondral transplantation is an effective technique for full-thickness chondral lesions of the femoral condyles, especially in younger patients with small, lateral femoral condyle lesion and associated lesions.

TI  - Cross-Cultural Adaptation of the Greek Versions of the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale and Tegner Activity Scale
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose The Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale (LKSS) and the Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) are widely used instruments for assessing knee function and activity level in various knee pathologies, especially knee ligament injuries. The purpose of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the Greek versions of the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale (Gr-LKSS) and Tegner Activity Scale (Gr-TAS) and assess their reliability and validity in Greek patients suffering from various knee problems. Materials and methods Translation of the LKSS and TAS questionnaires was done according to established international guidelines. Fifty-five patients (32 males and 23 females; mean age: 24 ±7 years; range: 17-54 years) with various knee pathologies completed the Gr-LKSS and Gr-TAS along with the Greek versions of International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form, the Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADLS) and the Oxford Knee Score (OKS). Test-retest reliability was evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in 53 (96%) individuals, who completed the questionnaires again after 48-72 hours while abstaining from all forms of treatment. Internal consistency for the Gr-LKSS was measured using Cronbach's alpha and criterion-related validity was evaluated with the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) in relation to control questionnaires (IKDC, KOS-ADLS, OKS). The distribution of floor and ceiling effects were also determined. Results There were no problems during the forward-backward translation and cultural adaptation of the Gr-LKSS and Gr-TAS. Criterion-related validity was confirmed with moderate to high associations of Gr-LKSS and Gr-TAS (after injury) with the IKDC and KOS-ADLS (Pearson's r ranging between 0.61-0.71 and 0.64-0.73, respectively). However, weak correlations were yielded between both questionnaires with the OKS (r=0.14-0.19). The internal consistency for Gr-LKSS was high (Cronbach's alpha: 0.779) and the test-retest reliability was high for both questionnaires (Gr-LKSS: ICC=0.950; Gr-TAS before and after injury: ICCs of 0.877 and 0.876, respectively). Conclusion The cultural adaptation and validity of Gr-LKSS and Gr-TAS were successfully accomplished. These questionnaires are recommended for use in the evaluation of soft tissue knee disorders in both clinical practice and research.

TI  - The effect of patient and injury factors on long-term outcome after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2011
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term follow-up is required for accurate assessment of results after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and recent years have witnessed the publication of numerous papers detailing long-term outcomes. The primary aim of this systematic review was to determine which patient factors affect long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes based on the current literature. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review yielded 18 prospective manuscripts with minimum follow-up ranging from 5-12 years after ACL reconstruction. RESULTS: Longer follow-up was associated with increased radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis. Increased meniscal or articular cartilage pathology at ACL reconstruction were found to be associated with increased prevalence of radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis at long-term follow-up in most studies. There is currently insufficient evidence to correlate these intra-articular findings with decreases in clinical outcome measures. Further research is needed to determine the effect of body mass index (BMI) on long-term outcome after ACL reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-articular injuries noted at the time of ACL reconstruction affect long-term results. The effect of BMI and other patient factors is unclear. Long-term follow-up of large multicenter cohorts will provide definitive data on the relative importance of different factors in determining results of ACL reconstruction. Language: en

TI  - Identifying Individuals With an Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Deficient Knee as Copers and Noncopers: A Narrative Literature Review
PY  - 2011
AB  - Study Design Narrative literature review. Objectives First, to explore the differences and outcomes between individuals who have had anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and those who did not undergo surgical intervention, following a tear of the ACL. Second, to review the evidence related to the ability to identify individuals who may or may not need surgery after an ACL rupture. Finally, to describe the differences between copers and noncopers. Background ACL rupture may result in increased tibiofemoral laxity and impaired neuromuscular function, which ultimately may lead to knee instability and dysfunction. Individuals who opt to choose surgery due to these changes may be defined as “noncopers.” Conversely, those individuals who have an ACL-deficient knee without functional impairment and instability and successfully resume preinjury activity levels without surgical intervention may be defined as “copers.” Methods An electronic search was conducted up to April 2011, using medical subject hea...

TI  - Concurrent arthroscopic bicruciate ligament reconstruction using Achilles tendon-bone allografts: experience with 15 cases
PY  - 2008
AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical outcome of arthroscopically assisted combined anterior and posterior cruciate ligament (ACL/PCL) reconstructions using Achilles tendon-bone allografts. Methods Associated meniscus injuries were treated according to established methods prior to ligament reconstructions during arthroscopic surgery. Thirty Achilles ten-don-bone allografts were used to reconstruct torn ACL and PCL in 15 knees. At postoperative follow-up, all knees were graded using the modified IKDC and the Lysholm scoring systems just as done preoperatively. Results were analyzed compared with the contralateral healthy knees. Results Eleven men and 4 women with a minimum of 3-year follow-up (mean 38 months) were included in the study. Preoperatively, the group ratings by the modified IKDC standards were all severely abnormal. Twelve bicruciate reconstructions were performed in subacute or chronic stage (>3-8 weeks), 3 for acute ligamentous deficiencies (≤ 3 weeks). The noticeable early complication was transitory local fever combined with joint effusion in one case. At postoperative follow-up, 9 knees were normal, 5 nearly normal and 1 abnormal. On Lysholm score the difference was statistically significant (t-test, P Conclusions Achilles tendon-bone allograft offers an alternative for simultaneous arthroscopic ACL/PCL reconstructions. However, further investigation is needed to eradicate its potential immunogenicity for better use.

TI  - Factors related to additional knee injuries after anterior cruciate ligament injury.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Purpose: We reviewed 1,375 consecutive patients to determine whether patient gender, age at injury, or activity level at injury were related to the risk of additional knee injuries over time following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Type of Study: Retrospective case series. Methods: Survival analysis was used to analyze the effect of each factor while statistically controlling for the effect of time from ACL injury to reconstruction. Results: The risk of meniscus injury was significantly higher among male subjects (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5, P P = .021) but increased by 3.4 times for female subjects ( P P P Conclusions: Men had a consistently higher occurrence rate of meniscus injuries than did women. The risk of meniscus injuries increased at a higher rate over time among women. The risk of meniscus injuries increases when ACL reconstruction is performed more than 6 months after injury. The risk of articular cartilage lesions increases when ACL reconstruction is performed more than 1 year after injury. Level of Evidence: Level IV, Case Series.

TI  - Timing of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) ruptures are common but the ideal timing for ACL reconstruction following injury is unclear.
Objectives: To determine if there is a relationship between timing from ACL rupture to surgery and clinical, functional and patient-reported outcomes. To explore the feasibility of collecting clinicians’ views on ACL reconstruction timing.
Design and methods: A systematic review of five databases to identify studies investigating outcomes following different timing of reconstruction surgery and a pilot vignette study to identify variations in clinical decisions about timing of surgery in four different case scenarios.
Results: Systematic review: Ten studies were identified, only one was a randomised controlled trial. There appeared to be no difference in outcomes between early ( 6months) ACL reconstruction. The two studies on functional and/or patient reported outcomes had conflicting findings, with the trial suggesting no difference between early or delayed reconstruction. The studies had limited evidence about the relationship between timing of surgery and patient characteristics. Pilot Vignette study: The pilot vignette study had a response rate of 45% but a high question completion rate. There was clinical variation in timing between surgeons and across patient groups, but none recommended delayed surgery (>6 months).
Conclusions: Given the potential deleterious effects of meniscal and chondral injuries on knee function, delays of more than 6 months in patients deemed suitable for ACL surgery are not recommended, but there is some evidence that these delays are not common in practice. Further research on timing of ACL reconstruction should focus on shorter time-frames, functional and patient-reported outcomes, and the influence of patient characteristics, as available evidence is limited, inconsistent and of low quality. A vignette study seems feasible to provide insights on clinical decisions and guide current practice and future research.

TI  - Effect of Anterolateral Ligament Status and Inherent Knee Anatomy on Anterior Tibial Subluxation of the Lateral Compartment After Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: A Cohort Study Based on MRI Analysis.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Anterior tibial subluxation (ATS) of the lateral compartment entails a pathological tibiofemoral alignment in knees with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Causes of increased ATS after an acute ACL injury are not clear, but soft tissue abnormalities and bony variations of the knee are potential causes.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">To determine whether increased ATS of the lateral compartment in knees with acute ACL injury is associated with (1) anterolateral ligament (ALL) status and (2) inherent anatomy of the lateral femoral condyle (LFC) and lateral tibial plateau (LTP).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN">Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">A total of 337 patients with clinically diagnosed ACL injuries treated between September 2019 and August 2021 were retrospectively reviewed, and 119 patients with acute ACL injury were included. Of them, 79 patients with impaired ALL (ALL injury group) and 40 patients with intact ALL (ALL intact group) were identified based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The ATS of the lateral compartment measured on MRI was compared between the 2 groups. The bony anatomy of knees, quantified by the LFC length, LFC height, LTP length, and LTP slope, was also evaluated on MRI and correlated with the ATS with partial correlation coefficients. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify the independent predictors of increased ATS.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">The ATS of the lateral compartment in the ALL injury group was significantly larger than that in the ALL intact group (6.3 mm vs 4.0 mm, respectively; <i>P</i> = .001). In all included patients, the presence of ALL injuries independently predicted a mean increase in ATS of 1.8 mm (<i>P</i> = .003). In the ALL injury group, ATS was significantly correlated with LFC length (<i>r</i> = 0.463; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), LFC height (<i>r</i> = -0.415; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), and LTP slope (<i>r</i> = 0.453; <i>P</i> &lt; .001); further, a 1-mm increase in LFC length, 1-mm decrease in LFC height, and 1° increase in LTP slope independently predicted a mean increase in ATS of 0.7 mm (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), 0.6 mm (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and 0.5 mm (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), respectively. In the ALL intact group, there was no significant correlation between ATS and any bony parameter.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">An impaired ALL increased the ATS of the lateral compartment after acute ACL injuries. In patients with combined ALL injuries, a flatter LFC and a steeper LTP in the sagittal plane were predictors of a further increase in ATS.</AbstractText>

TI  - Comparison of an Innovative Rehabilitation, Combining Reduced Conventional Rehabilitation with Balneotherapy, and a Conventional Rehabilitation after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Athletes.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background Instability of the knee, related to anterior cruciate ligament injury, is treated by surgical reconstruction. During recovery, a loss of proprioceptive input can have a significant impact. Few studies have evaluated the benefits of rehabilitation of the knee in aquatic environment on functional outcomes. Objective This study aimed to compare an innovative rehabilitation protocol combining reduced conventional rehabilitation with aquatic rehabilitation, with a conventional rehabilitation, according to the National French Health Authority, in terms of kinetics, development of proprioceptive skills, and functional improvement of the knee. Methods 67 patients, who were amateur or professional athletes, were randomized into two groups: 35 patients followed the conventional rehabilitation protocol (Gr1) and 32 patients followed the innovative rehabilitation protocol (Gr2). Patients were evaluated before surgery, and at 2 weeks, 1, 2, and 6 months after surgery using posturography, and evaluation of muscular strength, walking performance and proprioception. This study is multicenter, prospective, randomized, and controlled with a group of patients following conventional rehabilitation (level of evidence I). Results For the same quality of postural control, Gr2 relied more on somesthesia than Gr1 at 6 months. The affected side had an impact on postural control and in particular on the preoperative lateralization, at 2 weeks and at 1 month. Lateralization depended on the affected knee, with less important lateralization in Gr2 preoperatively and at 1 month. The quadriceps muscular strength was higher in Gr2 than in Gr1 at 2 and 6 months and muscle strength of the external hamstring was greater in Gr2 than in Gr1 at 6 months. The isokinetic test showed a greater quadriceps muscular strength in Gr2. Gr2 showed a greater walking distance than Gr1 at one month. Gr2 showed an improvement in the proprioceptive capacities of the operated limb in flexion for the first 2 months. Conclusion The effectiveness of the innovative rehabilitation program permits faster recovery, allowing for an earlier return to social, sporting, and professional activities. Faster retrieval of knee function following aquatic rehabilitation would prevent both short-term risk of lesions of the contralateral limb due to overcompensation and long-term risk of surgery due to osteoarthritis.

TI  - Radiographic Tibial Tunnel Assessment After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Hamstring Tendon Autografts and Biocomposite Screws: A Prospective Study With 5-Year Follow-Up
PY  - 2017
AB  - Purpose To radiographically assess the tibial tunnel up to 5 years after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using hamstring tendon autografts and biocomposite interference screws. Methods Fifty-one patients underwent anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction with metal interference screws in the femur and biocomposite interference screws in the tibia. Standardized digital radiographs with weight-bearing anteroposterior and lateral views of the index knee were taken in the early postoperative period and at 2 and 5 years postoperatively. Of 51 patients, 40 (78%) underwent radiographic assessment on all 3 occasions. Subjective and objective clinical assessments were obtained preoperatively and at the 5-year follow-up. Results The mean follow-up period was 65 months (±3.9 months), with a minimum of 59 months. The width of the tibial tunnel on the anteroposterior view was 9.4 mm (±1.4 mm) in the early postoperative period and 9.2 mm (±1.5 mm) at 5 years ( P  = .64). The corresponding widths on the lateral view were 9.6 mm (±1.5 mm) in the early postoperative period and 9.0 mm (±1.4 mm) at 5 years ( P  = .014). In 33 of 40 patients (83%) the width of the tibial tunnel had decreased on 1 or both views at 5 years compared with the early postoperative period. The study group had improved significantly at the 5-year follow-up compared with the preoperative assessments in terms of the KT-1000 arthrometer laxity tests (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), pivot-shift test, Tegner activity scale, and Lysholm knee score ( P Conclusions In 83% of patients, the width of the tibial tunnel had decreased on 1 or both radiographic views at 5 years compared with the early postoperative period after ACL reconstruction using biocomposite interference screws.

TI  - Preoperative Diagnosis and Treatment Outcomes of Incarcerated Inferiorly Displaced Flap Tear of the Medial Meniscus: Comparison between Flap Tears with and without Incarcerated Fragment.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare preoperative variables and postoperative outcomes between flap tears with and without incarceration of inferiorly displaced fragments of medial meniscus and find distinct features of incarcerated flap tear of medial meniscus to improve preoperative diagnosis. 79 patients who underwent partial meniscectomy for flap tear of medial meniscus were classified into two groups: group U, usual flap tear without incarcerated fragment; group I, flap tear with incarcerated inferiorly displaced fragment. Patient characteristics and preoperative variables including duration of symptom aggravation were investigated. A comprehensive physical examination including joint line tenderness was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was carried out on all patients. Clinical assessments were performed with functional scores including visual analogue scale (VAS), and radiologic evaluation was conducted. Preoperative values and postoperative outcomes measured at the minimum follow-up duration of 2 years were compared between the groups. The groups did not differ significantly regarding postoperative outcomes by functional and radiological evaluations ( ). In making preoperative diagnosis, sensitivity of diagnosis based solely on MR images was significantly lower in group I (68.8%) than that in group U (90.5%) ( ). The following clinical features differed significantly between the groups: Patients in group I had higher scores in preoperative VAS (group U = 6.6; group I = 7.7) ( ) and shorter duration of symptom aggravation (group U = 13.8 weeks; group I = 3.9 weeks) ( ). Joint line tenderness was positive more distinctly in group I (100%) than in group U (74.6%). If displaced flap tear was properly resected, improved outcomes did not differ regardless of incarceration of flap tear. In diagnosing incarcerated inferiorly displaced flap tear, sensitivity of diagnosis based solely on MR images could be low. Distinguishing clinical findings would be helpful in obtaining a more appropriate diagnosis.

TI  - Knee Laxity in the Menstrual Cycle after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Case Series.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare anterior knee laxity (AKL), genu recurvatum (GR), and muscle stiffness between reconstructed and contralateral sides in females who underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction during early follicular and ovulatory phases. AKL was measured as an anterior displacement of the tibia using a KS measure. GR was measured as the range of motion of knee hyperextension using a hyperextension apparatus. Muscle stiffness was measured for semitendinosus (ST) and biceps femoris long head (BF) using a MyotonPRO. The study investigated eighteen knees in nine females (Age, 20.4 ± 1.5 years; BMI, 21.5 ± 1.5) with normal menstrual cycles at least 1 year after reconstruction using hamstring autograft. E2 (Estradiol) concentration did not differ between the two phases, but AKL on the reconstructed side was lower during the ovulatory phase (8.3 [5.9-9.3] mm) than during the early follicular phase (9.4 [7.3-9.7] mm) (<i>p</i> = 0.044, <i>r</i> = 0.756), whereas there was no significant difference between the two phases on the contralateral side. AKL side-to-side difference, GR, and muscle stiffness (ST and BF) on both sides did not differ in either phase. These results indicate that AKL may behave differently on the reconstructed and contralateral sides during the menstrual cycle.

TI  - Evaluation of the accuracy and intra- and interobserver reliability of three manual laxity tests for canine cranial cruciate ligament rupture-An ex vivo kinetic and kinematic study.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVES" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To investigate the accuracy and intra- and interobserver reliability of the cranial drawer test (CD), tibial compression test (TCT), and the new tibial pivot compression test (TPCT) in an experimental setting resembling acute cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR) and to elucidate the ability to subjectively estimate cranial tibial translation (CTT) during testing.</AbstractText>

          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Kinetic and 3D-kinematic data was collected while three observers performed the tests on each specimen with intact (INTACT) and transected cranial cruciate ligament (CCLD) and compared using three-way repeated-measures ANOVA. Subjectively estimated CTT (SCTT), obtained during a separate round of testing, was compared to kinematic data by Pearson correlation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">CTT was significantly higher for CCLD than for INTACT for all tests, resulting in 100% sensitivity and specificity. TPCT induced the highest CTT and internal rotation. Intra- and interobserver agreement of translation was excellent. For rotation and kinetics, agreement was more variable. SCTT strongly correlated with the objectively measured values.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The CD, TCT and the new TPCT were all accurate and reliable. The high translations and rotations during TPCT are promising, encouraging further development of this test. SCTT was reliable in our experimental setting.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Veterinary manual laxity tests are accurate and reliable in acute CCLR. The TPCT might have potential for the assessment of subtle and rotational canine stifle instabilities. The high reliability of SCTT implies that grading schemes for stifle laxity, similar to human medicine, could be developed.</AbstractText>

TI  - Posterior cruciate ligament replacement with a two-strand quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft and a tibial inlay technique.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Background: Complete ruptures of the posterior cruciate ligament alter knee kinematics and may result in functional limitations with sports and daily activities. We prospectively evaluated the functional results and knee stability after posterior cruciate ligament replacement with use of a two-strand quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft and a tibial inlay technique.

Methods: Nineteen patients were followed for a mean of thirty-five months postoperatively. All had a chronic knee injury, and eight had additional ligament reconstructions. The results were measured with stress radiography, arthrometric testing, and two validated knee-rating instruments.

Results: Eighteen patients rated the knee condition as improved. Before surgery, eleven patients had pain with daily activities, but only one had such pain at the time of the latest follow-up. Significant improvements were noted for pain, swelling, giving-way, walking, climbing stairs, squatting, running, jumping, and twisting and turning (all p ≤ 0.05). Eleven patients returned to low-impact sports, and two patients were able to participate in strenuous sports without problems. At the time of the latest follow-up, stress radiography revealed that fourteen knees had ≤5 mm of increased posterior tibial translation between the reconstructed and the contralateral side, three knees had 6 to 10 mm, and two knees had >10 mm. No knee had an infection, permanent limitation of knee motion, or patellar fracture.

Conclusions: Posterior cruciate ligament replacement produced reasonable subjective, functional, and objective results in this group of complex, chronic knee injuries. The tibial inlay approach was useful in nine revisions in which prior tibial tunnels had to be avoided.

Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions to Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Outcome and risk factors after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a follow-up study of 948 patients.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study was to assess the outcome and risk factors after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in a large group of patients. Type of Study: Case series. Methods: Included in this retrospective study were 948 patients (323 female, 625 male) with a symptomatic unilateral ACL rupture, who underwent arthroscopic reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft and interference screw fixation at 3 Swedish hospitals. The median age of the patients at the time of the index operation was 26 years (range, 14 to 53 years). The patients underwent surgery at a median of 12 months (range, 0.5 to 360 months) after their injury. Independent physiotherapists performed the follow-up examinations at a median of 32 months (range, 21 to 117 months) postoperatively. Results: Of the 948 patients, 550 (58%) underwent meniscal surgery before, during, or after the ACL reconstruction. The median Tegner activity level was 8 (range, 2–10) before injury, 3 (range, 0–9) preoperatively, and 6 (range, 1–10) at follow-up ( P v follow-up). At follow-up, the median Lysholm score was 90 points (range, 14–100), the median KT-1000 anterior side-to-side laxity difference was 1.5 mm (range, −6 to 13 mm), and the median 1-leg hop test quotient was 95% (0% to 167%) compared with the contralateral normal side. At follow-up, 69.3% of the patients were classified as normal or nearly normal according to the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation system. However, 36% of the patients were unable to or had severe problems performing the knee-walking test. Inferior results correlated with increased time period between the index injury and reconstruction and concomitant joint damage found at the index operation. Conclusions: Overall, the results were good after ACL reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft and interference screw fixation. Concomitant joint damage and a long time period between the injury and reconstruction are major risk factors for inferior outcome after ACL reconstruction. Level of Evidence: Level IV, case series.

TI  - Septic Arthritis after Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2004
AB  - <jats:p>Introduction: A retrospective review of postoperative infected anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction was done on 472 consecutive cases in one institution. The purpose was to assess the incidence, diagnosis, treatment and outcome factors.

Materials and Methods: Out of 472 arthroscopic-assisted ACL reconstructions performed between 1999 and 2002, 7 (1%) postoperative deep intra-articular infections were detected. Seven males with a mean age of 23 years (range, 19 to 30 years) formed the study group; 3 had undergone prior knee surgery.

Results: Four patients had acute infection (&lt;2 weeks), 3 had subacute infection (2 weeks to 2 months) and none had late infection (&gt;2 months). All were admitted within 24 hours of onset of symptoms and underwent immediate arthroscopic lavage, incision and drainage of abscess, debridement with graft retention and intravenous (8 to 31 days) followed by oral (4 to 6 weeks) antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus was present in 4 patients, Peptostreptococcus in 3, Klebsiella in 1, and Enterobacter in 1. The patients underwent an average of 1.4 arthroscopic procedures (range, 1 to 3 procedures), with an average hospital stay of 17.3 days per patient. All were evaluated at an average of 11.7 months (range, 5 to 26 months). In all cases, the infection resolved with stable knees and with all grafts and implants retained. Although rare, early diagnosis and prompt treatment of infection can result in successful eradication without sacrificing the graft.</jats:p>

TI  - Early and Delayed Surgery for Isolated ACL and Multiligamentous Knee Injuries Have Equivalent Results: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Early surgery for acute ligamentous injuries has recently shown good clinical and functional outcomes.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">To assess the advantages of early vs delayed surgery in patients undergoing isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or multiligament-injured knee (MLIK) surgery.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN">Meta-analyses of Level 1, 2, and 3 studies; Level of evidence, 4.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">A systematic search was performed via PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane for studies reporting outcomes of timing of surgery after isolated ACL injury or in the MLIK setting using accelerated rehabilitation protocols. Two analyses were conducted to differentiate early and delayed treatment (3- and 6-week cutoffs). Collected outcomes included meniscal or chondral lesions, failure and reoperation rates, range of motion (ROM) deficits, other complications, muscle strength, instrumented laxity, and functional outcomes. Outcomes were reported in risk ratios (RR) or mean differences with 95% CIs.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">For timing of isolated ACL surgery, 16 studies were included with 2093 patients. High-grade evidence indicated that there were no differences in meniscal or chondral lesions, failure and reoperation rates, stiffness, ROM deficits, complications, muscle strength, instrumented laxity, and functional outcomes between patients treated early and late (all <i>P</i> &gt; .05). When including only studies that set no preoperative criteria for early surgery, the findings were similar. Regarding MLIK surgery, 14 studies were included with 1172 patients. Low evidence was noted for the following: patients treated early had significantly fewer meniscal injuries (RR, 0.7; <i>P</i> = .04) and chondral injuries (RR, 0.5; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), while no differences were found in reoperation rates, complications, stiffness, ROM deficits, muscle strength, instrumented laxity, and functional outcomes between the groups. Other than higher Lysholm scores in the early group for the 3-week analysis (mean difference, 6.8; <i>P</i> = .01), there were no differences between cutoff analyses.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">This systematic review with meta-analysis found no differences in clinical and functional outcomes between early and delayed surgery for isolated ACL injuries. For MLIK injuries, there were also no differences in surgical outcomes between early and delayed surgery.</AbstractText>

TI  - Surgical management of knee dislocations.
PY  - 2004
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">The evaluation and management of knee dislocations remain variable and controversial. The purpose of this study was to describe our method of surgical treatment of knee dislocations with use of a standardized protocol and to report the clinical results.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Forty-seven consecutive patients presented with an occult (reduced) or grossly dislocated knee. Fourteen of these patients were not included in this series because of confounding variables: four had an open knee dislocation, five had vascular injury requiring repair, three were treated with external fixation, and two had associated injury. The remaining thirty-three patients underwent surgical treatment for the knee dislocation with our standard approach. Anatomical repair and/or replacement was performed with fresh-frozen allograft tissue. Thirty-one of the thirty-three patients returned for subjective and objective evaluation with use of four different knee rating scales at a minimum of twenty-four months after the operation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Nineteen of the thirty-one patients were treated acutely (less than three weeks after the injury) and twelve, chronically. The mean Lysholm score was 91 points for the acutely reconstructed knees and 80 points for the chronically reconstructed knees. The Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living scores averaged 91 points for the acutely reconstructed knees and 84 points for the chronically reconstructed knees. The Knee Outcome Survey Sports Activity scores averaged 89 points for the acutely reconstructed knees and 69 points for the chronically reconstructed knees. According to the Meyers ratings, twenty-three patients had an excellent or good score and eight had a fair or poor score. Sixteen of the nineteen acutely reconstructed knees and seven of the twelve chronically reconstructed knees were given an excellent or a good Meyers score. The average loss of extension was 1 degrees, and the average loss of flexion was 12 degrees. There was no difference in the range of motion between the acutely and chronically treated patients. Four acutely reconstructed knees required manipulation because of loss of flexion. Laxity tests demonstrated consistently improved stability in all patients, with more predictable results in the acutely treated patients.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Surgical treatment of the knee dislocations in our series provided satisfactory subjective and objective outcomes at two to six years postoperatively. The patients who were treated acutely had higher subjective scores and better objective restoration of knee stability than did patients treated three weeks or more after the injury. Nearly all patients were able to perform daily activities with few problems. However, the ability of patients to return to high-demand sports and strenuous manual labor was less predictable.</AbstractText>

TI  - High Rate of Overlapping Question Content Among Commonly Used Patient-Reported Outcome Measurements for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury.
PY  - 2021
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To precisely compare the questions and content between the most commonly cited knee-specific patient-reported outcome measurements (PROs) for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A literature review through Medline from November 1, 2018, to November 1, 2020, was performed to find the most cited knee-specific PROs for assessment of ACL injuries. Each question was then classified as 1) identical, similar, or unique; 2) pertaining to 1 of 6 domains (pain, symptoms, functional activities, occupational activities, sports/recreation, and quality of life). The PROs were then compared to each other to assess question overlap and domain coverage.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 133 questions were analyzed from the seven most common PROs: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, Tegner Activity Scale, Marx Scale, Knee Outcome Survey (KOS), and Cincinnati Knee Rating System (CKRS). The total distribution of identical (31.6%), similar (31.6%), and unique (36.8%) questions was found to be relatively even. However, this distribution varied within each PRO. KOS and Lysholm had the highest percentages of identical questions (64% and 62.5%, respectively). KOOS had the highest number of unique questions (26/42, 61.9%), while Tegner held the highest percentage (11/16, 68.8%). Sports/recreation was the only domain assessed by all PROs.</AbstractText>

TI  - Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates quadriceps motor cortex inhibition and facilitation during rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction: a triple-blind, randomised controlled proof of concept trial.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Objectives" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), maladaptive changes occur in the motor cortex representation of the quadriceps, evidenced by increases in intracortical inhibition and facilitation. The primary objective of this proof-of-concept study was to determine if anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can alter quadriceps intracortical inhibition and facilitation in an early-ACLR population after 6 weeks of application during exercise.</AbstractText>

Anodal-tDCS or sham-tDCS was delivered to the primary motor cortex for 20 min, three times per week, for 6 weeks from week 2 post ACLR. Transcranial magnetic stimulation quantified quadriceps short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) and short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF). Significance at p&lt;0.05.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Participants were randomised to anodal (n=11) or sham (n=10) tDCS.

TI  - Twelve Weeks of a Staged Balance and Strength Training Program Improves Muscle Strength, Proprioception, and Clinical Function in Patients with Isolated Posterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ligament reconstruction is indicated in patients with an isolated posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury who fail conservative treatment. To eliminate the need for PCL reconstruction, an ideal rehabilitation program is important for patients with an isolated PCL injury. The purpose of this study was to investigate the improvement in functional outcome, proprioception, and muscle strength after a Both Sides Up (BOSU) ball was used in a balance combined with strength training program in patients with an isolated PCL injury. Ten patients with isolated PCL injuries were recruited to receive a 12 week training program as a study group. In the control group (post-PCL reconstruction group), ten subjects who had undergone isolated PCL reconstruction for more than 2 years were enrolled without current rehabilitation. The Lysholm score, IKDC score, proprioception (active and passive), and isokinetic muscle strength tests at 60°/s, 120°/s, and 240°/s, were used before and after training on the injured and normal knees in the study group, and in the post-PCL reconstruction group. The results were analyzed with a paired <i>t</i>-test to compare the change between pre-training, post-training, and the normal leg in the study group, and with an independent <i>t</i>-test for comparisons between the study and post-PCL reconstruction groups. Both the Lysholm and IKDC scores were significantly improved (<i>p</i> < 0.01) after training, and no difference was observed compared to the post-PCL reconstruction group. The active and passive proprioception was improved post-training compared to pre-training, with no difference to that in the post-PCL reconstruction group. Isokinetic knee quadriceps muscle strength was significantly greater post-training than pre-training in PCL injured knees at 60°/s, 120°/s, and 240°/s, and in hamstring muscle strength at 60°/s and 120°/s. Muscle strength in the post-training injured knee group showed no significant difference compared to that in the post-training normal leg and the post-PCL reconstruction group. The post-training improvement of muscle strength was higher in the PCL injured leg compared to the normal leg and there was no difference between the dominant and non-dominant injured leg in the study group. After 12 weeks of BOSU balance with strength training in patients with an isolated PCL injury, the functional outcome, proprioception, and isokinetic muscle strength were significantly improved, and comparable to the contralateral normal leg and the post-PCL reconstruction group. We suggest that programs combining BOSU balance and strength training should be introduced in patients with a PCL injury to promote positive clinical results.

TI  - Side-to-side asymmetries in landing mechanics from a drop vertical jump test are not related to asymmetries in knee joint laxity following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Asymmetries in knee joint biomechanics and increased knee joint laxity in patients following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are considered risk factors for re-tear or early onset of osteoarthritis. Nevertheless, the relationship between these factors has not been established. The aim of the study was to compare knee mechanics during landing from a bilateral drop vertical jump in patients following ACLR and control participants and to study the relationship between side-to-side asymmetries in landing mechanics and knee joint laxity. Seventeen patients following ACLR were evaluated and compared to 28 healthy controls. Knee sagittal and frontal plane kinematics and kinetics were evaluated using three-dimensional motion capture (200 Hz) and two synchronized force platforms (1000 Hz). Static anterior and internal rotation knee laxities were measured for both groups and legs using dedicated arthrometers. Group and leg differences were investigated using a mixed model analysis of variance. The relationship between side-to-side differences in sagittal knee power/energy absorption and knee joint laxities was evaluated using univariate linear regression. A significant group-by-leg interaction (p = 0.010) was found for knee sagittal plane energy absorption, with patients having 25% lower values in their involved compared to their non-involved leg (1.22 ± 0.39 vs. 1.62 ± 0.40 J kg−1). Furthermore, knee sagittal plane energy absorption was 18% lower at their involved leg compared to controls (p = 0.018). Concomitantly, patients demonstrated a 27% higher anterior laxity of the involved knee compared to the non-involved knee, with an average side-to-side difference of 1.2 mm (p < 0.001). Laxity of the involved knee was also 30% higher than that of controls (p < 0.001) (leg-by-group interaction: p = 0.002). No relationship was found between sagittal plane energy absorption and knee laxity. Nine months following surgery, ACLR patients were shown to employ a knee unloading strategy of their involved leg during bilateral landing. However, this strategy was unrelated to their increased anterior knee laxity. Side-to-side asymmetries during simple bilateral landing tasks may put ACLR patients at increased risk of second ACL injury or early-onset osteoarthritis development. Detecting and correcting asymmetric landing strategies is highly relevant in the framework of personalized rehabilitation, which calls for complex biomechanical analyses to be applied in clinical routine.

TI  - POSTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT REPLACEMENT WITH A TWO-STRAND QUADRICEPS TENDON-PATELLAR BONE AUTOGRAFT AND A TIBIAL INLAY TECHNIQUE
PY  - 2005
AB  - Background: Complete ruptures of the posterior cruciate ligament alter knee kinematics and may result in functional limitations with sports and daily activities. We prospectively evaluated the functional results and knee stability after posterior cruciate ligament replacement with use of a two-strand quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft and a tibial inlay technique. Methods: Nineteen patients were followed for a mean of thirty-five months postoperatively. All had a chronic knee injury, and eight had additional ligament reconstructions. The results were measured with stress radiography, arthrometric testing, and two validated knee-rating instruments. Results: Eighteen patients rated the knee condition as improved. Before surgery, eleven patients had pain with daily activities, but only one had such pain at the time of the latest follow-up. Significant improvements were noted for pain, swelling, giving-way, walking, climbing stairs, squatting, running, jumping, and twisting and turning (all p ≤ 0.05). Eleven patients returned to low-impact sports, and two patients were able to participate in strenuous sports without problems. At the time of the latest follow-up, stress radiography revealed that fourteen knees had ≤5 mm of increased posterior tibial translation between the reconstructed and the contralateral side, three knees had 6 to 10 mm, and two knees had >10 mm. No knee had an infection, permanent limitation of knee motion, or patellar fracture. Conclusions: Posterior cruciate ligament replacement produced reasonable subjective, functional, and objective results in this group of complex, chronic knee injuries. The tibial inlay approach was useful in nine revisions in which prior tibial tunnels had to be avoided. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions to Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Does ACL reconstruction restore knee stability in combined lesions?: An in vivo study.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Treating anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesions combined with a torn medial collateral ligament (MCL) is controversial because residual laxity may lead to stretching of the ACL graft and eventual failure of the reconstruction. Few studies describe the in vivo translations of combined ACL and MCL injuries. We compared the preoperative and postoperative laxity between patients with combined ACL+MCL Grade II injuries and isolated ACL ruptures and tested whether an ACL reconstruction could restore all laxities in both groups. We evaluated knee kinematics during ACL reconstruction in 57 patients (37 ACL lesions and 20 ACL+MCL injury). Laxity tests were performed before and after graft fixation. Postoperatively, there was greater anteroposterior laxity and greater varus-valgus laxity in the group with MCL injury compared to the group with an ACL lesion only. This finding suggests residual laxities remain when ACL reconstruction is performed in patients with combined ACL+MCL lesion, and raises the question of addressing the MCL ligament when Grade II laxity is found.

TI  - Incomplete bicruciate knee injuries: Results of treatment with isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract Purpose: To determine how the presence of a partial injury to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in conjunction with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear affects the outcome of ACL reconstruction. Type of Study: Case series. Methods: Between 1990 and 1998, 18 patients with surgically documented complete ACL ruptures and partial PCL tears, referred to as "incomplete bicruciate knee injuries," were treated with arthroscopic ACL reconstruction and PCL observation. Fifteen patients (83%) were available for follow-up evaluation at a mean of 60 months postoperatively. Follow-up evaluation consisted of physical examination, standard radiographs, isokinetic muscle testing, KT instrumented laxity testing, stress radiographs for posterior and total anterior-posterior translation, and Lysholm, Tegner, and IKDC outcome scores. Results: At follow-up, 11 patients had a negative Lachman and 4 had a 1+ Lachman (3 to 5 mm translation). Instrumented arthrometer tests performed at follow-up showed less than 3 mm of increased anterior translation versus the opposite knee on manual maximum testing at 30° in 11 patients, and 3 to 5 mm translation in the remaining 4 patients, with an average of 1.3 mm increased translation. Symptomatic posterior instability was present in only 1 patient who had sustained a repeat injury resulting in a complete PCL tear postoperatively. Final IKDC outcome scores were normal or near normal in 13 patients (87%) and abnormal in 2 (13%). The average Lysholm score was 93 at follow-up, and only 1 patient had a score lower than 80. Conclusions: Overall, the results of treatment of incomplete bicruciate knee injuries in this study compare favorably with the results of isolated ACL reconstruction reported in other series. We conclude that the clinical significance of an arthroscopically defined partial PCL tear in an ACL-deficient knee is minor, and that isolated ACL reconstruction in this setting appears to be effective treatment.

TI  - Bone mineral assessments in the calcaneus after anterior cruciate ligament injury An investigation of 92 male patients before and two years after reconstruction or revision surgery
PY  - 1998
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the Bone Mineral Areal mass (BMA) in the calcaneus of male patients with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury before and after reconstruction and to assess whether the BMA ratio or the BMA of the injured and uninjured side correlated with the level of activity, functional performance or the time period between the injury and the reconstruction. Ninety-two male patients with unilateral ACL injury were included in the study. The BMA was analysed immediately prior to surgery: a median of 11 (2-192) months after the injury in 30 patients aged 26 (15-41) years scheduled for primary ACL reconstruction (Group A). Forty-nine patients aged 29 (18-49) years had their BMA analysed a median of 24 (23-29) months after the primary ACL reconstruction (Group B). Thirteen patients aged 27 (21-39) years had their BMA analysed a median of 24 (20-45) months after ACL revision surgery (Group C). The median BMA ratio (injured side/uninjured side) was 96 (88-105)% in Group A, 96 (86-118)% in Group B and 95 (83-111)% in Group C. In all three groups, the median BMA value in the calcaneus was significantly lower on the injured side compared with the uninjured side (P=0.001, P=0.0003, P=0.01 in Groups A, B and C, respectively). The time period between the injury and the reconstruction neither correlated with the BMA ratio nor the BMA of the injured or the uninjured side in Group A. The level of activity as measured by the Tegner activity level and the functional performance as measured by the one-leg-hop quotient did not correlate with the BMA ratio in any of the groups. In the 49 patients with a primary ACL reconstruction (Group B), the post-operative Tegner activity level correlated with the BMA, on both the injured and uninjured side (P=0.0003, P=0.0005, respectively), when the BMA was assessed two years after the index operation. Male patients with unilateral ACL injury had a significantly lower BMA in the calcaneus on the injured side compared with the uninjured side before primary reconstruction, two years after primary reconstruction and two years after revision surgery. The time period between the injury and the index operation did not correlate with the BMA. A high level of activity correlated with the BMA on both the injured and the uninjured side two years after primary reconstruction.

TI  - Posterior Cruciate Ligament reconstruction augmentation on avulsion PCL: A case series
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Introduction Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) avulsion may mimics PCL rupture with positive posterior drawer test. Treatment of choice to PCL avulsion is vary from open surgery to arthroscopic surgery. PCL reconstruction with augmentation is a rare procedure to be performed in treating PCL avulsion case. This case reported and suggested an augmentation procedure in PCL avulsion case. This study aims is to evaluate the knee functional score using augmented PCL reconstruction on PCL avulsion using peroneus longus tendon. Presentation of case We report 3 cases, 1 male and 2 females. The result of physical examination, X-ray examination, and MRI of the knee showed a PCL avulsion. Posterior drawer test showed grade 2 result. We performed an augmented PCL reconstruction on PCL avulsion using peroneus longus tendon. Knee scoring (IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, Tegner-Lysholm) collected pre-operative and 2 years post-operative. The result of knee scoring was significant improved in post-operative compare to before surgery. Conclusion Augmented PCL reconstruction can be considered to be an alternative treatment of PCL avulsion because the procedure has excellent post-operative knee scoring result.

          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Sixteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The return to sports (RTS) rates after microfracture ranged from 44% to 83%, and to preinjury level from 25% to 75%. The RTS rates after OAT ranged from 87% to 100%, and to preinjury level from 67% to 93%. The RTS rates after OCA ranged from 77% to 80%, and to preinjury level 64%. The RTS rates after ACI ranged from 33% to 96%, and to preinjury level from 26% to 67%.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">There was a high heterogeneity and range in rates of RTS in athletes participating in pivoting sports. Most studies reported high rates of RTS; however, return to preinjury level was lower.

TI  - A Single-Leg Vertical Hop Test Is an Effective Tool to Measure Functional Performance after Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction
PY  - 2024
AB  - <jats:p>This study evaluated the single-leg vertical hop test (SLVHT), using digital sensor technology, for the functional assessment of rehabilitation progress in patients after ACL reconstruction (ACL-R). Between January 2019 and June 2022, 143 patients (26.6 (8.9) years, m/f 66/34%) completed return-to-sport testing at 3 and 6 months after ACL-R. The jump height during SLVHT was quantified with a digital motion sensor, containing a three-axis acceleration gyroscope sensor, and the limb symmetry index (LSI) (injured/non-injured leg ratio) was calculated. Three months postoperatively, the jump height of the injured leg was 59.6% (13.5 (5.5) cm) that of the non-injured leg (22.9 (6.2) cm; p &lt; 0.01). After 6 months, the jump height of the injured leg (18.4 (6.9) cm) improved by 44.1% compared to that at the 3-month follow-up but was still lower than the non-injured leg jump height (23.2 (7.0) cm, p &lt; 0.001; LSI = 79.6%). Men jumped higher than women, but their LSI was not different at 3 (59.6 vs. 59.5%) and 6 months (80.6 vs. 77.8%). Regression analysis identified the non-injured leg jump height as the primary independent predictor of the jump height of the injured leg (β = 0.776, T = 51.506, p &lt; 0.001). SLVHT, using digital sensor technology, is a simple and cost-effective functional test to assess rehabilitation progress after ACL-R, with the potential for multi-centre data analysis.</jats:p>

PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Despite the prevalence of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to evaluate results after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, there exists little standardization in how these metrics are reported, which can make wider comparisons difficult.</AbstractText>

TI  - Contralateral Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture 11 Years or More Post ACL Repair With Either Hamstring Tendon or Patellar Tendon Autografts
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common but devastating injuries. After ACL reconstruction there is an elevated risk of rupture to the contralateral ACL, and this risk may be increased over time with patellar tendon autografts. Does risk of rupture increase for the contralateral ACL 11 years or more after ACL reconstruction when using a patellar tendon versus a hamstring tendon autograft? Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline-OVID, PubMed, and CINAHL using the keywords: anterior cruciate ligament, contralateral, rupture, and long term. Results were limited to human studies. Relevant article were assessed for quality using the GRADE criteria. Results: Two studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria for this systematic review. One randomized controlled trial enrolled 64 patients who underwent arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with either a hamstring tendon (HT) autograft or patellar tendon (PT) autograft and were followed for 11 years. After 11 years of follow-up, there were 6% (n=2) of patients with HT autograft ruptures and 12% (n=4) with PT graft ruptures. A cohort study of 180 patients underwent arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with either a HT or PT autograft; they were followed for 15 years. After 15 years, patients receiving PT autografts (26% (n=23)) experienced twice as many contralateral ACL ruptures compared to those with HT autografts (12% (n=11)). Conclusion: Hamstring tendon autografts appear to be superior to patellar tendon autografts with a reduced risk of contralateral anterior cruciate ligament rupture 11 or more years after ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Reasons for Not Returning to Pre-injury Sport Level After ACL-Reconstruction.
PY  - 2024
AB  - The study aimed to identify athlete-reported reasons for not returning to pre-injury sports level after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and to identify the factors associated with these reasons. Ninety-one athletes with 2 years post-ACLR indicated whether or not they had returned to their pre-injury sport level (same frequency, duration, and intensity). Athletes who did not return were asked to provide the reasons. Athletes' characteristics and injury-related factors were used to determine factors associated with the reasons for not returning. Only nine athletes (10%) returned to pre-injury sport level after ACLR. The most common reasons for not returning were lack of confidence or concerns about re-injury (48.8%), followed by continued post-surgical impairments in the reconstructed knee (39%). Having episodes of the knee giving way after ACLR was the only significant predictor of post-surgical impairments (48.8%; OR=8.3, 95%CI=2.48-27.42, p=0.001). Lack of confidence, concerns about re-injury, or post-surgical impairments in the reconstructed knee were the most frequently reported reasons for not returning to pre-injury sports level with 2 years post-ACLR. Reported dynamic knee instability was the only factor associated with ongoing post-surgical knee impairments after ACLR. Rehabilitation programs should address athletes' psychological responses and resolve knee impairments to optimize return to pre-injury sport level after ACLR.

TI  - ORIGINALARBEIT / ORIGINAL PAPER Anterior Cruciate Ligament preservation during reconstructive surgery: Does the extra surgical effort improve patient outcomes at one year?
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background: The aim of this prospective cohort study was to compare patient-reported and clinical outcomes at one year post-operatively in patients who had a standard quadruple stranded hamstring tendon anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction to those who had ACL tissue preservation with a double semitendinosus reconstruction. Materials and Methods: Forty-five patients were selected for ACL preservation surgery (ACL Preserved group) and were matched by age, sex and injury acuity to 45 patients who had a standard reconstruction (ACL Reconstructed group). The primary outcome was the validated ACL-QOL score. Secondary outcomes included the IKDC Subjective and Objective assessments, clinical and instrumented laxity testing, and Tegner Activity Level. All outcomes were measured at baseline and at a minimum of one year post-operatively, by an independent qualified assessor. Results: The two patient groups were similar for all baseline characteristics except for a larger number of meniscal pathology in the ACL Reconstructed group. Both groups had statistically significant and clinically important improvement from baseline to one year. The ACL Preserved group showed better results for all outcomes. The ACL-QOL change score from baseline was 8.6 points (p=0.04) higher for the ACL Preserved compared to the ACL Reconstructed group. KT-2000 measurements showed a statistically significant side-to-side difference between groups. The IKDC Objective assessment reported 87% of patients with normal/nearly normal knees in the ACL Preserved group compared to 80% in the ACL Reconstructed group. Conclusions: In patients where it is possible and feasible to preserve ACL tissue, this study suggests that the more technically demanding procedure involving ACL preservation during reconstructive surgery is worth the extra effort. The procedure provides a consistent and measurable benefit in terms of knee stability and quality of life at one year post-operative, compared to a standard hamstring reconstruction. Level of evidence: Therapeutic, prospective cohort study; Level II.

TI  - Unilateral stance strategies of athletes with ACL deficiency.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Aberrant movement strategies are characteristic of ACL-deficient athletes with recurrent knee instability (non-copers), and may instigate premature or accelerate joint degradation. Biomechanical evaluation of kinematic changes over time may elucidate noncopers’ responses to neuromuscular intervention and ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Forty noncopers were randomized into a perturbation group or a strength training only group. We evaluated the effects of perturbation training, and then gender on knee angle and tibial position during a unilateral standing task before and after ACLR. No statistically significant interactions were found. Before surgery, the strength training only group demonstrated knee angle asymmetry, but 6 months after ACLR, both groups presented with similar knee flexion between limbs. Aberrant and asymmetrical tibial position was found only in females following injury and ACLR. Neither treatment group showed distinct unilateral standing strategies following intervention; however, males and f...

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament injury, Patient Variables, Outcomes and Knee Osteoarthritis
PY  - 2010
AB  - The ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) leads to immediate symptoms that severely affect the individual and receives great attention among the scientific community, yet there is still no consensus on the optional form of treatment. An ACL injury is also a well known high risk factor for the development of knee osteoarthritis (OA) some decades later. Knee OA development after an ACL injury is multi-factorial. All patient variables must be further explored before better guidelines on ACL injury treatment can be issued. I studied 100 patients with an acute complete ACL tear over 15 years and evaluated the outcome after a primary non-surgical treatment algorithm based on early neuromuscular knee rehabilitation by a physical therapist and initial activity restrictions. Patients had less radiographic knee OA than in historical retrospective studies, and still had very small subjective symptoms. When OA was present, a concomitant meniscal injury treated by means of partial meniscectomy was the most important risk factor. Another cohort of 29 ACL-injured patients were examined with delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) to estimate cartilage GAG content, as a proxy for cartilage integrity. Results indicated knee cartilage GAG changes 2 years after an ACL injury. Patients who had sustained a meniscectomy, or had a BMI > 25 kg/m2, had the most impaired cartilage quality, which supports the contention that this method can detect a cartilage matrix change that may be indicative of increased risk of OA. The data presented can help medical staff in decision-making when treating the ACL-injured patient. (Less)

TI  - Assessing knee functionality: systematic review of validated outcome measures.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Background Functional rating scales allow clinicians to document and quantify alterations and progression of recovery processes. There is neither awareness of numerous knee scales nor are they easy to find or compare to select the most suitable. Objectives We aimed to compile validated knee functional rating tools and analyse the methodological quality of their validation studies. Also, we aimed to provide an operational document of the outcome measures addressing descriptions of parameters, implementations, instructions, interpretations and languages, to identify the most appropriate for future interventions. Methods A systematic review involved a search of PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Scopus, and Dialnet databases from inception through September 2020. The main inclusion criteria were available functional rating scales/questionnaires/indexes for knees and validation studies. Methodological quality was analyzed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) and COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments Risk of Bias (COSMIN-RB). Results We selected 73 studies. The studies investigated 41 knee rating tools (general, 46%, and specific, 54%) and 71 validations, including 29,742 individuals with knee disorders. QUADAS-2 obtained the best results in patient selection and index test (applicability section). COSMIN-RB showed the highest quality in construct validity (most analyzed metric property). The specific tools were mainly designed for prosthesis and patellofemoral and anterior cruciate ligament injuries. More considered issues were specific function (93%), especially gait, pain/sensitivity (81%), and physical activity/sports (56%). Conclusions and implications We conducted a necessary, useful, unlimited-by-time and feasible compilation of validated tools for assessing knee functional recovery. The methodological quality of the validations was limited. The best validations were for the Copenhagen Knee Range of Motion Scale in osteoarthritis and arthroplasties, Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living and Lysholm Knee Score for general knee disorders and the Tegner Activity Score for anterior cruciate ligament injuries. The operational document for the scales provides necessary data to identify the most appropriate.

TI  - Surgical management of multiple knee ligament injuries
PY  - 2013
AB  - Objectives To summarize our experience and mid-term results of reconstruction with Iliotibial tract grafts for multiple ligament injuries. Methods Between July 1997 and December 2003, multiple ligament injuries of 15 patients were reconstructed with Iliotibial tract grafts in arthroscopy. There were 5 women and 10 men. The mean age at the time of the surgery was 30.5 years (range 25–43 years). There were 7 cases who were injured with combined ACL rupture and the PCL, and 8 cases were with disruption of both the ACL and the PCL, combined with damage of the medial collateral ligament. Results Fifteen patients were followed up for a mean of 7.5 years (range 6–12 years). The overall mean postoperative Lysholm score was 84.3 ± 5.7. At final IKDC qualification, 60.0 % of the knees were normal or nearly normal. The overall average Tegner activity score decreased significantly at the re-examination compared to the activity score before accident (3.6 ± 0.5 vs. 5.1 ± 0.6). Conclusions Reconstruction with Iliotibial tract grafts in arthroscopy was a reliable treatment for multiple ligament injuries.

TI  - A randomized trial of treatment for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
        <jats:p>Objective
 The aim of this study was to explore the effects of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) in patients with anterior cruciate ligament(ACL) reconstruction(ACLR).
Methods
 We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving 72 eligible patients with ACL reconstruction in which we compared two strategies: the experimental group was standard rehabilitation plus rESWT and the control group was standard rehabilitation plus sham rESWT. The outcome was the change from baseline to 24 weeks in the average score on Lysholm knee joint score (LKS), range of motion (ROM), visual analogue scale (VAS) and International Knee Literature Committee (IKDC).
Results
 Of 36 subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus rESWT, 4 lost to follow up. Of 36 assigned to rehabilitation plus sham rESWT, 5 lost to follow up. The LKS, ROM and IKDC scores of the experimental group were markedly increased at 3 and 6 weeks after treatment (P &lt; 0.001), and the VAS was notably decreased (P &lt; 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in the LKS, ROM, IKDC and VAS between the groups at 24 weeks after treatment(P &gt; 0.05).
Conclusion
 The strategy of rehabilitation plus rESWT had better functional outcomes after ACL reconstruction. As such, our study demonstrates that rESWT is essential for patients with ACL reconstruction. Early use of rESWT can improve joint function, pain relief and ability of daily living. rESWT has a positive effect on the overall rehabilitation of patients.</jats:p>

TI  - The Clinical Application of Machine Learning Models for Risk Analysis of Ramp Lesions in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Peripheral tears of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus, known as "ramp lesions," are commonly found in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-deficient knees but are frequently missed on routine evaluation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">To predict the presence of ramp lesions in ACL-deficient knees using machine learning methods with associated risk factors.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN">Cohort study (Diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">This study included 362 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between June 2010 and March 2019. The exclusion criteria were combined fractures and multiple ligament injuries, except for medial collateral ligament injuries. Patients were grouped according to the presence of ramp lesions on arthroscopic surgery. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors including age, sex, body mass index, time from injury to surgery (≥3 or &lt;3 months), mechanism of injury (contact or noncontact), side-to-side laxity, pivot-shift grade, medial and lateral tibial/meniscal slope, location of bone contusion, mechanical axis angle, and lateral femoral condyle (LFC) ratio. The receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were also evaluated.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Ramp lesions were identified in 112 patients (30.9%). The risk for ramp lesions increased with steeper medial tibial and meniscal slopes, higher knee laxity, and an increased LFC ratio. Comparing the final performance of all models, the random forest model yielded the best performance (area under the curve: 0.944), although there were no significant differences among the models (<i>P</i> &gt; .05). The cut-off values for the presence of ramp lesions on receiver operating characteristic analysis were as follows: medial tibial slope &gt;5.5° (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), medial meniscal slope &gt;5.0° (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and LFC ratio &gt;71.3% (<i>P</i> = .033).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">Steep medial tibial and meniscal slopes, an increased LFC ratio, and higher knee rotatory laxity were observed risk factors for ramp lesions in patients with an ACL injury. The prediction model of this study could be used as a supplementary diagnostic tool for ramp lesions in ACL-injured knees. In general, care should be taken in patients with ramp lesions and its risk factors during ACL reconstruction.</AbstractText>

TI  - Influence of a Concomitant Medial Meniscus Injury on Knee Joint Function and Osteoarthritis Presence after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <b>(1) Background:</b> The aim of this study was to investigate how a medial meniscus injury accompanying an anterior cruciate ligament rupture affects the clinical outcome 10 years after ACL reconstruction. <b>(2) Methods:</b> A total of 37 patients who received anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) were included in this retrospective study. Two groups were analyzed at a single follow-up of 10 years: (i) "isolated (ACLR)" (<i>n</i> = 20) and (ii) "ACLR with medial meniscal injury" (<i>n</i> = 17). The following clinical scores were recorded: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm Score and Tegner Activity Score. To determine the degree of osteoarthritis the Kellgren-Lawrence score was used. <b>(3) Results:</b> The "isolated ACLR" study group scored significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05) on the IKDC subjective questionnaire (mean: 88.4) than the "ACLR with medial meniscus injury" group (mean: 81). The KOOS category "activities of daily living" showed significantly better results in the isolated ACLR group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The "ACLR with medial meniscus injury" group had significantly higher degree of osteoarthritis (<i>p</i> < 0.05). No significant differences were found in all the other clinical scores. <b>(4) Conclusions:</b> The results of this study further indicate that patients with a concomitant medial meniscus injury have slightly more discomfort in everyday life and increased risk of developing osteoarthritis 10 years after surgery.

PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Zusammenfassung</jats:title><jats:p>Trotz einer anatomischen Rekonstruktion des vorderen Kreuzbands werden unverändert hohe Versagensraten sowie persistierende anterolaterale Instabilitäten beobachtet, sodass die anterolaterale Rotationsinstabilität vermehrt in den wissenschaftlichen und klinischen Fokus rückte. Für die Sicherung der anterolateralen Rotationsinstabilität ist der Tractus iliotibialis mit seinen tiefen Strukturen entscheidend, wobei auch knöcherne Faktoren zur Pathogenese der anterolateralen Instabilität beitragen. Entsprechend wird die Rekonstruktion des vorderen Kreuzbands im klinischen Alltag zunehmend durch zusätzliche anterolaterale extraartikuläre Rekonstruktionen ergänzt, was trotz des Risikos einer unphysiologischen Gelenkkinematik in den guten klinischen Kurzzeitergebnissen begründet ist. Mögliche Indikationen stellen Revisionsfälle oder Hochrisikokonstellationen dar, wobei die Langzeitfolgen dieser Prozeduren noch nicht abgeschätzt werden können.</jats:p>

TI  - Functional outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery
PY  - 2019
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most common sports injuries with a reported yearly incidence rate of over two million injuries worldwide. The main aim of this thesis is to investigate various aspects related to the functional outcomes of ACLR through a series of clinical studies. Ethical approval was sought and granted by the North of Scotland Research Ethics Service. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the outcome measures used in Level I and II clinical ACLR studies. The review showed wide variability in the outcome measures utilised with no consensus on the ideal outcome instrument or combination of instruments to report the outcome of ACLR. Five-year results from the UK National Ligament Registry (NLR) were analysed with review for limitations of registry data and future recommendations. The data analysed provided a comprehensive review for the demographics, surgical techniques and functional outcomes of ACLR surgery across the UK. NLR data is limited by multiple factors including high rate of incomplete data, duplication of data, poor patient compliance and lack of validation of the data. A study was conducted to examine the hypothesis that patients with ACLR do not return to their pre-injury functional status at two years postoperatively. The study showed significant improvement in patient symptoms postoperatively compare to their post-injury scores, but the majority of patients failed to achieve their pre-injury functional outcome scores at 2 years postoperatively. In a comparative study, the anteromedial portal (AM) technique in femoral tunnel drilling was compared with the trans-tibial (TT) technique with respect to radiological and functional outcomes. The hypothesis was that AM portal produces better functional outcomes compared with TT technique. We found that the AM portal achieved a more anatomical position of the graft but there was no difference between the two techniques in functional outcome at 2 years postoperatively. However, ACLR with the AM portal technique had higher graft failure rate compared with the TT technique. The medium- term outcome of all-inside meniscal repairs was investigated in a longitudinal study. Meniscal repairs with concomitant ACLR had a lower failure rate compared with isolated meniscal repairs. This indicates that surgeons should have a low threshold for repairing meniscal tear during ACLR surgery. The healing response technique was studied in a selected group of patients with complete proximal ACL tears. This technique yielded good functional outcome for most of the patients at 2 years postoperative follow up. The studies included in this thesis provides substantial information for surgeons treating patients with ACL injuries. It provides a platform for further research studies investigating the outcomes of ACLR surgery.

TI  - Human Trials on the Prevention of Tunnel Widening by the Emdogain in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Background Although anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is an established procedure, some problems remain, such as bone tunnel widening after ACLR. In animal studies, Emdogain (EMD) prevented tunnel widening by promoting tendon-bone healing. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of EMD on the prevention of tunnel widening after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in humans. Methods Nineteen patients who underwent ACLR were included. Seven patients in the EMD group were administered EMDs into the femoral tunnel during ACLR, while 12 patients in the control group were not administered EMDs. After surgery, at two and four weeks and three, six, and 12 months, femoral and tibial tunnel widening were evaluated on computed tomography images. Anteroposterior laxity and clinical scores such as the Lysholm score, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective form, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were assessed before surgery and 12 months postoperatively. Results Tunnel widening on the femoral side was significantly smaller in the EMD group than in the control group at two weeks. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups at 12 months. There were no significant differences in anteroposterior laxity and clinical scores between the groups before and 12 months after surgery. Conclusion EMD administration into the bone tunnel did not prevent tunnel widening at 12 months after ACLR, although tunnel widening of the femoral tunnel was reduced by EMD administration in the early phase.

PY  - 2012
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Septic arthritis is a rare but potentially devastating complication of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. Several studies, including one by this group, have reported short- and medium-term outcomes, but to our knowledge there are no long-term follow-up studies.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="HYPOTHESIS" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">Postoperative septic arthritis after ACL reconstruction surgery will lead to diminished long-term outcomes compared with surgery without infectious complications, likely related to the development of arthritis.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="METHODS">Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Four of 831 consecutive patients undergoing arthroscopically guided ACL reconstruction surgeries performed by 1 surgeon were previously reported on by this group at an average follow-up of 36 months. These same patients were contacted and reevaluated. Each patient underwent a physical examination, functional testing, and subjective evaluations with the SF-36, Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner activity scale scores. Plain film radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were analyzed by 2 musculoskeletal radiologists.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Average follow-up time for this study was 17.9 years, and average age was 44.3 years. No other injuries or surgeries had occurred from the time of the previous study. Each patient had a decline in SF-36, Lysholm, and IKDC score, and the average Tegner score was unchanged. Average vertical hop test performance and Biodex dynamometry were both improved. The average side-to-side displacement measured via the KT-1000 arthrometer was increased. Radiographic and MRI studies revealed progression of arthritis in all patients and ACL graft rupture in 1 patient.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Patients who develop septic arthritis as a complication of ACL reconstruction surgery have diminished long-term subjective, functional, and radiographic outcomes compared with historical reports of uncomplicated cases, likely related to pain from advanced arthritis. As compared with their own earlier follow-up, these patients had declines in pain-related subjective measures but remained stable or improved in both functional testing and activity-related subjective scales.</AbstractText>

PY  - 2025
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is often recommended for treatment of an ACL injury; however, the literature reports similar outcomes for those undergoing rehabilitation alone. We assessed the clinical, functional, sports participation, and osteoarthritis outcomes following our treatment algorithm, and compared 10-year outcomes among participants who chose progressive rehabilitation alone, early ACLR, or delayed ACLR.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We included 276 participants who had a unilateral ACL injury without substantial concomitant knee injuries in a prospective cohort study. Treatment choice was based on shared decision-making after a 5-week progressive rehabilitation program. At the 10-year follow-up, we assessed patient-reported outcomes (International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form [IKDC-SKF], Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], and patient acceptable symptom state [PASS] achievement), quadriceps strength, hop performance, sports participation, and weight-bearing radiographs.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Sixty-nine percent of the participants (191 participants; 99 male and 92 female; 6 African American, 7 Asian, 59 Caucasian, 119 unknown) attended the 10-year follow-up, including 98% (53) of 54 participants who had rehabilitation alone, 68% (114) of 167 with early ACLR, and 69% (24) of 35 with delayed ACLR. Among the entire cohort, 78% (126 of 162) reported having a PASS, 72% (109 of 151) had symmetrical quadriceps strength, ≥85% (≥116 of ≤137) had a symmetrical hop performance, 93% (162 of 174) were still engaged in some kind of sports, only 1% (1 of 139) had symptomatic osteoarthritis, and 12% (17 of 139) had radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis. We found similar outcomes after rehabilitation alone and early ACLR. The participants who underwent delayed ACLR had similar outcomes to the other 2 groups except for significantly lower KOOS Sports scores, KOOS Quality of Life scores, and hop performance (p ≤ 0.03). Participants who had rehabilitation alone were older, less active, and more likely to have concomitant lateral meniscal injuries than those who underwent ACLR.</AbstractText>

          <AbstractText Label="Study Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 97 patients who underwent primary double-bundle ACLR between June 2016 and March 2021 and underwent surgery to remove staples, with at least 12 months of follow-up evaluation, were enrolled. Quantitative measurements were performed under general anesthesia immediately before ACLR (preoperatively), after temporary fixation of the ACL graft (intraoperatively), and immediately before staple removal (postoperatively). The laxity of pivot shift was assessed using inertial sensors to measure acceleration and external rotational angular velocity (ERAV). Descriptive data were assessed for associations with postoperative acceleration and ERAV in a univariate analysis. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with postoperative acceleration and ERAV.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Anterior tibial translation, acceleration, and ERAV increased from intra- to postoperatively (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). Factors significantly associated with postoperative acceleration were age (β = -0.238; <i>P</i> = .021), lateral posterior tibial slope (PTS) (β = 0.194; <i>P</i> = .048), and preoperative acceleration (β = 0.261; <i>P</i> = .008). Factors significantly affecting postoperative ERAV were age (β = -0.222; <i>P</i> = .029), ramp lesions (β = 0.212; <i>P</i> = .027), and preoperative ERAV (β = 0.323; <i>P</i> = .001).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Greater preoperative laxity in the pivot shift was the factor having the most significant association with residual pivot shift after ACLR using quantitative measurements under general anesthesia. Younger age, higher lateral PTS, and concomitant ramp lesions were significant predictors of residual pivot shift. These findings can help pre- and intraoperative decision-making regarding whether an anterolateral structure augmentation should be added.</AbstractText>

TI  - Allograft Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Adolescent Patients May Result in Acceptable Graft Failure Rate in Nonpivoting Sports Athletes.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Studies have demonstrated that pediatric patients have an increased risk of failure with allograft anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR); however, there is no study investigating whether allograft ACLR may be safe in older adolescent patients who are not returning to competitive pivoting sports (ie, low risk). The purpose of this study was to assess outcomes for low-risk older adolescents selected for allograft ACLR.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We performed a retrospective chart review of patients younger than 18 years who received a bone-patellar-tendon-bone allograft or autograft ACLR by a single orthopaedic surgeon from 2012 to 2020. Patients were offered allograft ACLR if they did not intend to return to pivoting sports for 1 year. The autograft cohort was matched 1:1 based on age, sex, and follow-up. Patients were excluded for skeletal immaturity, multiligamentous injury, prior ipsilateral ACLR, or concomitant realignment procedure. Patients were contacted to obtain patient-reported outcomes at ≥2 years follow-up, including single assessment numerical evaluation, surgery satisfaction, pain scores, Tegner Activity Scale, and the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used as appropriate.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Of the 68 allografts, 40 (59%) met inclusion and 28 (70%) were contacted. Among the 456 autografts, 40 (8.7%) were matched and 26 (65%) were contacted. Two allograft patients (2/40; 5%) failed at a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 36 (12, 60) months. There were 0/40 failures in the autograft cohort and 13/456 (2.9%) among the overall autografts; neither were significantly different from the allograft failure rate (both P &gt; 0.05). Two (5.0%) patients in the autograft cohort required manipulation under anesthesia and arthroscopic lysis of adhesions. There were no significant differences between cohorts for single assessment numerical evaluation, Lysholm, Tegner, pain, and satisfaction scores (all P &gt; 0.05).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Although ACL allograft failure rates remain nearly two times higher than autograft failure rates in older adolescents, our study suggests that careful patient selection can potentially bring this failure rate down to an acceptable level.</AbstractText>

TI  - Pivot Shift Syndrome of the Knee.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The pivot shift test, in contrast to the Lachman or anterior drawer, is a manually subjective clinical test that simulates the injury mechanism. It is the most sensitive test to determine ACL insufficiency. This paper reviews the history, development, research, and treatment associated with the pivot shift phenomenon which is associated with tearing and loss of function of the knee anterior cruciate ligament. The pivot shift test most closely recapitulates what the symptomatic anterior cruciate ligament deficient patient feels is happening which is an abnormal translation and rotation of the injured joint during flexion or extension. The test is best conducted in the relaxed patient by applying knee flexion, tibial external rotation, and valgus stress. The pivot shift biomechanics and treatment measures are reviewed.

TI  - At 10-Year Minimum Follow-Up, One-Third of Patients Have Patellofemoral Arthritis After Isolated Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction Using Gracilis Tendon Autograft.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">To report the long-term clinical outcomes after isolated medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLr) to treat recurrent patellar instability.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">This was a single-center study of patients undergoing an isolated MPFLr between 2000 and 2011. All patients underwent reconstruction using hamstring autograft. The inclusion criteria were a minimum 10-year follow-up period and skeletally mature patients with more than 1 episode of patellar dislocation who underwent MPFLr without an associated bony procedure.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">A total of 54 knees were available for final analysis. The mean follow-up period was 12.3 years (range, 10-14 year). The mean age at surgery was 25 years. No patients had patellofemoral arthritis (PFA) prior to surgery. Preoperatively, the mean Caton-Deschamps index was 1.1 and the mean tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance was 14.9 ± 2 mm (range, 7-17 mm). All patients had trochlear dysplasia according to the Dejour classification. At final follow-up, the mean Kujala score was 82.9 ± 15.3; mean International Knee Documentation Committee score, 78.3 ± 18.5; and mean Tegner score, 4.0 ± 1.7. Patients with an unsatisfactory outcome as determined by a Kujala score lower than 80 had a higher Caton-Deschamps index preoperatively and were more likely to be female patients; however, neither factor reached significance. Of the patients, 33 (66%) had no radiographic evidence of PFA whereas 15 (30%) had Iwano stage 1 and 2 had Iwano stage 2 (4%). At final follow-up, 4 patients (7.4%) had recurrent instability requiring revision surgery.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">Isolated MPFLr with gracilis tendon autograft in appropriately selected patients is an effective long-term treatment for recurrent patellofemoral instability with low rates of recurrence. One-third of patients exhibit radiographic evidence of PFA more than 10 years after isolated MPFLr.</AbstractText>

TI  - Factors Influencing the Initial Constraint Level of the Knee Joint and Its Effect on Clinical Outcomes After ACL Reconstruction With Hamstring Graft.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A force-based tension protocol that uses a certain amount of tension at graft fixation could still give rise to variations in initial constraint levels of the knee joint in terms of side-to-side difference (SSD) in anterior translation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Purpose" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To investigate the factors influencing the initial constraint level in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-reconstructed knees and compare outcomes according to the level of constraint in terms of anterior translation SSD.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Study Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Included were 113 patients who underwent ipsilateral ACL reconstruction using an autologous hamstring graft and had minimum 2-year follow-up outcomes. All grafts were tensioned and fixed at 80 N using a tensioner at the time of graft fixation. The patients were classified into the following 2 groups according to the initial anterior translation SSD, measured using the KT-2000 arthrometer: a physiologic constraint group with restored anterior laxity ≤2 mm (group P; n = 66) and a high-constraint group with restored anterior laxity &gt;2 mm (group H; n = 47). Clinical outcomes were compared between the groups, and preoperative and intraoperative variables were evaluated to identify factors affecting the initial constraint level.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Between group P and group H, generalized joint laxity (<i>P</i> = .005), posterior tibial slope (<i>P</i> = .022), and anterior translation measured in the contralateral knee (<i>P</i> &lt; .001) were found to differ significantly. Measured anterior translation in the contralateral knee was the only significant predictor of high initial graft tension (<i>P</i> = .001). No significant differences were found between the groups regarding clinical outcomes and subsequent surgery.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Greater anterior translation measured in the contralateral knee was an independent predictor of a more constrained knee after ACL reconstruction. The short-term clinical outcomes after ACL reconstruction were comparable, regardless of the initial constraint level in terms of anterior translation SSD.</AbstractText>

TI  - Meniscal transplantation in symptomatic patients less than fifty years old.
PY  - 2005
AB  - BACKGROUND:

The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the results of meniscal transplantation in a consecutive series of younger patients treated for pain in the tibiofemoral compartment following a previous meniscectomy.

METHODS:

Forty cryopreserved menisci were implanted into thirty-eight patients. Sixteen knees also had an osteochondral autograft transfer, and nine had a knee ligament reconstruction. The clinical outcome and failure rate of all transplants were evaluated at a mean of forty months postoperatively. Meniscal allograft characteristics were determined with use of a rating system that combined subjective, clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging factors.

RESULTS:

Thirty-four (89%) of the thirty-eight patients rated the knee condition as improved. Before surgery, thirty patients (79%) had pain with daily activities, but only four (11%) had such pain at the time of the latest follow-up. While noteworthy pain was present in the tibiofemoral compartment in all forty knees before surgery, twenty-seven knees (68%) had no pain and thirteen (33%) had only mild compartment pain at the time of the latest follow-up. Twenty-nine patients (76%) returned to light low-impact sports without problems. Concomitant osteochondral autograft transfer and knee ligament reconstruction procedures improved knee function and did not increase the rate of complications. Meniscal allograft characteristics were normal in seventeen knees (43%), altered in twelve (30%), and failed in eleven (28%).

CONCLUSIONS:

The short-term results of meniscal transplantation are encouraging in terms of reducing knee pain and increasing function; however, long-term transplant function and any chondroprotective effects remain unknown and require further investigation.

TI  - Patient reported outcome measures in anterior cruciate ligament rupture and reconstruction: The significance of outcome score prediction.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Numerous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) clinical outcome measures exist. However, the result of one score does not equate to the findings of another even when evaluating the same patient group.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="AIM" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To investigate if statistically derived formulae can be used to predict the outcome of one knee scoring system when the result of another is known in patients with ACL rupture before and after reconstruction.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Fifty patients with ACL rupture were evaluated using nine clinical outcome measures. These included Tegner Activity Score, Lysholm Knee Score, Cincinnati Knee Score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Objective Knee Score, Tapper and Hoover Meniscal Grading Score, IKDC Subjective Knee Score, Knee Outcome Survey - Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADLS), Short Form-12 Item Health Survey and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Thirty-four patients underwent an ACL reconstruction and were reassessed post-operatively.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The mean total of each of the nine outcome scores appreciably differed from each other. Significant correlations and regressions were found between most of the outcome scores and were stronger post-operatively. The strongest correlation was found between Cincinnati and KOS-ADLS (<i>r</i> = 0.91, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). The strongest regression formula was also found between Cincinnati and KOS-ADLS (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.84, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The formulae produced from this study can be used to predict the outcome of one knee score when the results of the other are known. These formulae could facilitate the conduct of systematic reviews and meta-analysis in studies relating to ACL injuries by allowing the pooling of substantially more data.</AbstractText>

TI  - Several factors predict the achievement of the patient acceptable symptom state and minimal clinically important difference for patient-reported outcome measures following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A systematic review.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To summarize the predictors of the patient acceptable symptom state (PASS), minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and minimal important change (MIC) for patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">MEDLINE, PubMed and Embase were searched from inception to 5 January 2024. The authors adhered to PRISMA/R-AMSTAR guidelines, and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Data on statistical associations between predictive factors and PROMs were extracted. Inverse odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (reverse group comparison) were calculated when appropriate to ensure comparative consistency.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Thirteen studies comprising 21,235 patients (48.1% female) were included (mean age 29.3 years). Eight studies comprising 3857 patients identified predictors of PASS, including lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) (OR = 11.08, p = 0.01), hamstring tendon (HT) autografts (OR range: 2.02-2.63, p ≤ 0.011), age over 30 (OR range: 1.37-2.28, p ≤ 0.02), male sex (OR range: 1.03-1.32, p ≤ 0.01) and higher pre-operative PROMs (OR range: 1.04-1.21). Eight studies comprising 18,069 patients identified negative predictors of MCID or MIC, including female sex (OR = 0.93, p = 0.034), absence of HT autografts (OR = 0.70, p &lt; 0.0001), higher pre-operative PROMs (OR = 0.76-0.84, p ≤ 0.01), meniscectomy (OR = 0.67, p = 0.014) and collision sports (OR = 0.02-0.60, p ≤ 0.05).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Higher pre-operative PROMs, age over 30, male sex, LETs and HT autografts predicted PASS achievement. Lower pre-operative PROMs, male sex, non-collision sports, and lack of meniscectomies predicted MCID/MIC achievement. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the predictors of clinically significant post-ACLR outcomes, thus improving clinical decision-making and the management of patient expectations.</AbstractText>

TI  - Compressive force and valgus torque are the predominant applied loads during the pivot shift exam: An in vitro study.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">Despite the clinical utility of the pivot shift exam, the requisite applied forces and torques to elicit a pivot shift remain unclear. The purposes of this study are (1) to identify the greatest forces and torques applied to the knee during the pivot shift exam and (2) to evaluate if the applied loads differ among experienced surgeons.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Three cadaveric hemipelvis-to-toe specimens (ages 53, 36 and 31 years; two males and one female) with no history of knee or hip injury were utilized. The experimental setup consisted of securing the hemipelvis to a mounting frame via an external fixator to simulate patient positioning during the clinical exam. The hemipelvis, femur, and tibia were spatially tracked by motion capture and the applied loads were measured using a 6-axis force-torque sensor. After sectioning the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), three board-certified sports medicine surgeons then performed the pivot shift exam on each specimen utilizing their preferred technique. Forces (compression-distraction, anterior-posterior, and medial-lateral) and torques (varus-valgus, internal-external rotation, and flexion-extension) applied to the knee joint immediately preceding the reduction of the proximal lateral tibia during each pivot shift exam were calculated.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Compression was the largest applied force averaging 95 N ± 15 N for all surgeons and knees, which was at least 4.5 times greater, on average, than the applied anterior and applied medial tibial forces (p &lt; 0.0001). Valgus was the largest of the three applied torques, averaging 8.5 ± 2.1 Nm. Internal rotation torque was 3.7 times less, on average, than the applied valgus torque (p &lt; 0.0001). Each surgeon applied compressive force. However, anterior force was more variable among surgeons, with one of the three surgeons applying minimal anterior force (p ≤ 0.024). The magnitude of applied torques was similar among examiners (n.s).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Compressive force and valgus torque were the predominant applied loads during the pivot shift exam. A lower magnitude of internal rotation torque was also applied. The anterior force was not consistently applied among examiners. These data can better inform clinical, cadaveric, and computational studies utilizing the pivot shift exam to assess knee biomechanics and can be used to educate trainees in conducting this complex manoeuvre.</AbstractText>

TI  - Larger Chondral Lesions Treated with Collagen Membrane - Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrogenesis - Show Larger Increase in Clinical Scores.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate clinically and radiologically the results of the treatment of chondral lesions using collagen membrane - autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC). Methods This is a series of observational cases, in which 15 patients undergoing AMIC were analyzed. The clinical evaluation was made by comparing the Lysholm and International Knee Document Commitee (IKDC) scores in the pre- and postoperative period of 12 months, and radiological evaluation using the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score in the same postoperative period. Results The mean age of the patients was 39.2 years old, and the mean size of the chondral lesions was 1.55cm2. There was a significant improvement in clinical scores, with a mean increase of 24.6 points on Lysholm and of 24.3 on IKDC after 12 months. In the radiological evaluation, MOCART had a mean of 65 points. It was observed that the larger the size of the lesion, the greater the improvement in scores. Conclusion Evaluating subjective clinical scores, the treatment of chondral lesions with the collagen membrane showed good results, as well as the evaluation of MOCART, with greater benefit in larger lesions.

TI  - International Knee Documentation Committee Knee Survey Use After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A 2005-2012 Systematic Review and World Region Comparison
PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this review was to evaluate International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) survey use after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction compared with other surveys and determine evidence levels and methodologic study quality by world region. Methods The Medline database was searched from January 2005 through December 2012. Results We identified 421 studies and 33 surveys. Europe and Australia had more objective and subjective IKDC form use (χ 2  = 9.6, P  = .047). Europe and Asia had more objective IKDC form use (χ 2  = 19.4, P  = .001). Asia had more Lysholm knee scale use (χ 2  = 29.9, P 2  = 31.7, P 2  = 20.5, P 2  = 21, P 2  = 24.4, P  = .018). Europe had more studies with greater than 24 months' follow-up (χ 2  = 18.4, P  = .018). Asia had more studies with adequate surgical descriptions (χ 2  = 33.2, P 2  = 18.2, P  = .02). Europe had more studies with confirmed recruitment (χ 2  = 12.9, P  = .012). Australia and North America had more studies with confirmed independent investigators (χ 2  = 11.1, P  = .026). Europe had more studies with greater than 80% recruitment (χ 2  = 16.0, P  = .04). Methodologically stronger studies used the objective IKDC survey ( P P  = .002), or the Cincinnati or Noyes scale ( P  = .002). This group also made greater use of the Tegner scale ( P  = .013). Conclusions Objective and subjective IKDC form use is comparable with Lysholm and Tegner scale use. Objective and subjective IKDC form use in combination with the Tegner Activity Level scale is recommended. Level of Evidence Level IV, systematic review of Level I-IV studies.

TI  - A Pilot Study of Anatomic Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Ligament Remnant Tissue Preservation
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the preliminary results of an anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction procedure with ligament remnant tissue preservation. Methods By use of the transtibial technique, 2 doubled semitendinosus tendons were grafted into 4 tunnels created at the center of each bundle attachment, penetrating the ACL remnant tissue. In total, 44 patients (27 male and 17 female patients) with an isolated ACL injury underwent ACL reconstruction with this procedure. The mean age of the patients was 29 years (range, 17 to 58 years). Postoperative clinical evaluations were performed at 16.6 months on average (range, 12 to 23 months). Radiologic evaluations were also performed to evaluate the tunnel location in the femur and the tibia. Results The mean operation time was 86 minutes (range, 72 to 96 minutes) in the cases with ACL reconstruction only. Postoperatively, the mean anterior laxity was 0.7 mm. The postoperative pivot-shift test was negative in 81.8% of the patients, whereas there were no patients evaluated as ++. No patients showed any extension or flexion deficit. There were no patients evaluated as "nearly abnormal" or "abnormal" according to the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation. The tunnel angles of the 4 tunnels were identical to those reported in a previous study. Conclusions The minimal 1-year clinical results of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with ligament remnant tissue preservation were comparable to previously reported results of anatomic double-bundle reconstruction without remnant tissue preservation. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in children and adolescents: A retrospective study.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Background Indications and outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in children and adolescents is still controversial. It was the aim of this study to analyze outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in this special age group. Methods Retrospectively, we analyzed 62 consecutive cases of ACL reconstruction using a physis crossing technique in six to 16-year-old patients with a mean follow-up of 69 months. Results Cases operated later than six weeks after trauma had significantly more meniscal lesions than patients operated within six weeks of trauma. At last follow-up, we found good or very good subjective and objective results in 71% of the patients. Conclusion In active and healthy children with anterior knee instability after ACL tear, ligament reconstruction is a safe and successful procedure and should be considered within six weeks of trauma because instability seems to promote secondary meniscal lesions.

TI  - Arthroscopic fixation of an avulsion fracture of the tibia involving the posterior cruciate ligament: a modified technique in a series of 22 cases
PY  - 2015
AB  - A total of 22 patients with a tibial avulsion fracture involving the insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) with grade II or III posterior laxity were reduced and fixed arthroscopically using routine anterior and double posteromedial portals. A double-strand Ethibond suture was inserted into the joint and wrapped around the PCL from anterior to posterior to secure the ligament above the avulsed bony fragment. Two tibial bone tunnels were created using the PCL reconstruction guide, aiming at the medial and lateral borders of the tibial bed. The ends of the suture were pulled out through the bone tunnels and tied over the tibial cortex between the openings of the tunnels to reduce and secure the bony fragment. Satisfactory reduction of the fracture was checked arthroscopically and radiographically. The patients were followed-up for a mean of 24.5 months (19 to 28). Bone union occurred six weeks post-operatively. At final follow-up, all patients had a negative posterior drawer test and a full range of movement. KT-1000 arthrometer examination showed that the mean post-operative side-to-side difference improved from 10.9 mm (standard deviation (sd) 0.7) pre-operatively to 1.5 mm (sd 0.6) (p = 0.001). The mean Tegner and the International Knee Documentation Committee scores improved significantly (p = 0.001). The mean Lysholm score at final follow-up was 92.0 (85 to 96). We conclude that this technique is convenient, reliable and minimally invasive and successfully restores the stability and function of the knee.

TI  - Corticospinal and intracortical excitability differ between athletes early after ACLR and matched controls.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Neuromuscular impairments, such as quadriceps weakness and activation deficits, persist after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Recent research demonstrating changes in the function of the primary motor cortex after ACLR posits that quadriceps impairments may be influenced by reduced corticospinal excitability. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the integrity of the neuromotor axis of the vastus medialis is altered in subjects 2 weeks post-ACLR compared to uninjured control subjects. Eighteen athletes 2 weeks post-ACLR and 18 age and sex matched uninjured control subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. We quantified corticospinal (resting motor threshold, RMT; motor evoked potential amplitudes at 120% RMT, MEP120 ) and intracortical (inhibition and facilitation) excitability using single and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), respectively. We assessed spinal-reflex excitability (H-reflex amplitude normalized to maximal M-wave, H/M ratio) using peripheral stimulation. Subjects post-ACLR had higher RMTs (p = 0.001), greater MEP120 amplitudes (p = 0.001), and more asymmetric facilitation (p = 0.041) than the uninjured control subjects. No significant group differences were found for intracortical inhibition (p = 0.289) and H/M ratio (p = 0.332). Our findings indicate that both intracortical and corticospinal excitability of vastus medialis are bilaterally altered in subjects 2 weeks after ACLR. Given persistent neuromuscular deficits seen after ACLR, rehabilitation strategies targeting intracortical and corticospinal deficits may potentially improve clinical outcomes. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: Panther Symposium ACL Injury Clinical Outcomes Consensus Group.
PY  - 2020
AB  - A stringent outcome assessment is a key aspect of establishing evidence-based clinical guidelines for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury treatment. To establish a standardized assessment of clinical outcome after ACL treatment, a consensus meeting including a multidisciplinary group of ACL experts was held at the ACL Consensus Meeting Panther Symposium, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, in June 2019. The aim was to establish a consensus on what data should be reported when conducting an ACL outcome study, what specific outcome measurements should be used, and at what follow-up time those outcomes should be assessed. The group reached consensus on 9 statements by using a modified Delphi method. In general, outcomes after ACL treatment can be divided into 4 robust categories: early adverse events, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), ACL graft failure/recurrent ligament disruption, and clinical measures of knee function and structure. A comprehensive assessment after ACL treatment should aim to provide a complete overview of the treatment result, optimally including the various aspects of outcome categories. For most research questions, a minimum follow-up of 2 years with an optimal follow-up rate of 80% is necessary to achieve a comprehensive assessment. This should include clinical examination, any sustained reinjuries, validated knee-specific PROs, and health-related quality of life questionnaires. In the midterm to long-term follow-up, the presence of osteoarthritis should be evaluated. This consensus paper provides practical guidelines for how the aforementioned entities of outcomes should be reported and suggests the preferred tools for a reliable and valid assessment of outcome after ACL treatment.

TI  - Anterior cruciate ligament assessment using arthrometry and stress imaging.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Arthrometry and stress imaging are useful clinical tools for the objective assessment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) integrity. They are most frequently used for the diagnosis of a complete ACL tear when other workup is equivocal, in conjunction with history and clinical exam findings. Other applications include the diagnosis of partial ACL tears, injury prognosis, and post-operative monitoring. However, further studies are needed to validate these uses. Many different devices and techniques exist for objective examination, which have been compared in recent literature. Reliability and validity measures of these methods vary, and often depend upon examiner familiarity and skill. The KT series of devices is the current gold standard for arthrometry, although the newer robotic GNRB device shows promising early results. Newer methods of data interpretation have been developed for stress imaging, and portable technology may impact this field further.

Included patients were divided into 2 groups according to their history of smoking. Group 1 was composed of patients who had never smoked (n = 322), and group 2 consisted of patients who had reported smoking before ACL reconstruction and during rehabilitation (n = 165). Additionally, each group was divided into 4 subgroups according to the selected graft type (bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft, hamstring [semitendinosus-gracilis] tendon autograft, quadriceps tendon–bone autograft, or Achilles tendon–bone allograft). ...

TI  - Ligament augmentation and reconstruction system (LARS) synthetic grafts are safe and effective for medial collateral ligament and posterolateral corner reconstructions in elite athletes.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">This study documents the efficacy and safety of using a Ligament Augmentation and Reconstruction System (LARS) ligament graft to augment extra-articular knee ligament reconstructions in elite athletes by reporting return-to-play (RTP) rates and levels, career longevity and complications.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A consecutive series of all extra-articular knee ligament reconstructions augmented by LARS ligaments in elite athletes undertaken by three specialist sports knee surgeons between 2013 and 2020 were reviewed. Seventy-six elite athletes, aged over 16 years old, and more than 2 years postsurgery were included. RTP was defined as competing at professional level or national/international level in amateur sport.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">There were 64 medial collateral ligament (MCL) and 12 posterolateral corner (PLC) reconstructions. Fifty-two (68.4%) underwent concomitant autograft cruciate ligament(s) reconstruction. The mean age was 25.1 years (SD ± 4.5). Most were football (35, 46.1%) or rugby players (35, 46.1%). Sixty-seven athletes (88.2%) RTP with 65 (97.0%) of these playing at the same or higher Tegner level. Fifty-six (83.6%) of the athletes that RTP were still playing at 2 years postsurgery. Twenty (57.1%) of those who had RTP and were more than 5 years postsurgery were still playing at 5 years. Six (7.9%) players required further surgery relating to the LARS/metalwork. One case had soft tissue inflammation adjacent to the proximal end of the synthetic graft, but it is unknown if this was mechanical irritation or a biological reaction. One MCL reruptured 4 years after RTP.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Utilising LARS to augment extra-articular knee ligament reconstructions allows 88.2% of athletes with a variety of knee ligament injuries to return to elite sport. The low morbidity rates coupled with 57% of athletes still playing 5 years postsurgery demonstrates that the LARS is safe and effective in these cases. Although there are reports of LARS ligaments being used in MCL and PLC reconstructions, there is very little evidence investigating if they are safe and effective. This study demonstrates that LARS synthetic grafts can be safely used for MCL and PLC reconstructions in elite athletes and they permit a high RTP with a low risk of complications.</AbstractText>

TI  - Pain after out-patient vs. in-patient ACL reconstruction: French prospective study of 1076 patients.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Background Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair is increasingly performed on an out-patient basis. In France, however, concern about post-operative pain remains a strong barrier to out-patient ACL repair. The primary objective of this study was to compare post-operative pain after ACL repair as out-patient versus in-patient surgery. The secondary objectives were to assess the time-course of post-operative pain and to identify factors associated with pain intensity. Material and methods A multicentre, prospective, comparative, non-randomised study was conducted in France for the French Society for Arthroscopy (SFA) symposium. Patients who underwent primary ACL repair between January 2014 and March 2015 were included if they were eligible for out-patient surgery. The choice between out-patient and in-patient surgery was based on organisational and logistical considerations. Pain intensity was self-evaluated by the patients using a visual analogue scale (VAS), pre-operatively then in the evening after surgery, during the night after surgery, and 1, 3, and 5 days after surgery. The patients performed the evaluations at home using websurvey.fr ® software. Demographic data, the characteristics of the surgical procedure, and the IKDC and Lysholm scores before and after surgery were collected. Results Of the 1076 patients included in the study, 680 had out-patient surgery and 396 in-patient surgery. Mean age was 30 ± 9 years. The two groups were comparable at baseline. Pain intensity was not significantly different between the two groups at any of the measurement time points. Pain intensity showed a peak on post-operative day 1 that was similar in the two groups. The initial post-operative pain intensity score predicted subsequent pain intensity: patients with VAS scores  7) in the out-patient group were younger age, female gender, pre-operative VAS score > 3, and tourniquet time > 50 minutes. Conclusion Pain intensity is similar after out-patient and in-patient ACL repair. Concern about pain should not be a barrier to performing ACL repair on an out-patient basis. Our data on the time-course of the pain and factors associated with greater pain intensity should prove useful for improving patient management after ACL repair. Level of evidence Level III, case-control study.

TI  - Utilizing a contralateral hamstring autograft facilitates earlier isokinetic and isometric strength recovery after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a randomised controlled trial.
PY  - 2021
AB  - To compare muscle strength and patient reported outcomes following ACLR using a semitendinosus (ST) graft from the ipsilateral (IL) leg compared to a graft from the contralateral (CL) leg. One-hundred and forty patients with an ACL injury were randomized to IL or CL ACLR. Patients were assessed at 6, 12 and 24 months with isokinetic and isometric muscle strength measured using Biodex. Patient-reported outcomes and manual stability measurements were also recorded. Patient-related outcomes improved over time for both groups with no significant differences between groups at any time point. No differences between groups in objective knee assessment scores or rerupture rates were found. The IL group was significantly weaker in knee flexion strength at all time points compared to the CL group, additionally the IL group did not recover flexor strength within 2 years. This study demonstrated that utilizing an ST graft harvested from the uninjured limb for ACLR facilitates early isokinetic and isometric strength recovery, with no significant adverse outcomes demonstrated in other measurements and therefore be performed to reduce the risk of long-term strength deficits in the injured leg II.

TI  - An alternative to fixation of displaced fractures of the anterior intercondylar eminence in children
PY  - 2002
AB  - Fractures of the anterior intercondylar eminence in children are relatively uncommon. There is considerable debate as to the best treatment of displaced fractures, but most methods described in the literature involve an open procedure combined with some form of fixation. Using human anatomical dissections, we have shown that the transverse meniscal ligament can become incarcerated within the fracture and act as a block to reduction. We describe an arthroscopic technique which requires no fixation device and report the results of its use in eight displaced fractures. This method gives reliable results and offers the advantage of less potential morbidity.

TI  - Revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction restores knee laxity but shows inferior functional knee outcome compared with primary reconstruction
PY  - 2018
AB  - To evaluate and compare knee laxity and functional knee outcome between primary and revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in the same cohort of patients. Patients who underwent primary and revision ACL reconstruction (ACLR) at Capio Artro Clinic, Stockholm, Sweden, from 2000 to 2015, were identified in our local database. Inclusion criteria were: same patients who underwent primary hamstring tendons (HT) and revision bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) autograft ACLR, no associated ligament injuries and no contralateral ACL injuries/reconstructions. The cause of revision ACLR was graft rupture for all patients. The KT-1000 arthrometer, with an anterior tibial load of 134-N, was used to evaluate knee laxity preoperatively and 6-month postoperatively. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was collected preoperatively and at the 1-year follow-up. A total of 118 patients with primary and revision ACLR arthrometric laxity measurements were available (51.0% males; mean age at primary ACLR 21.7 ± 7.1 years and revision ACLR 24.3 ± 7.5 years). The mean preoperative and postoperative anterior side-to-side (STS) difference values were not significantly different between primary and revision ACLR. However, primary ACLR showed a significantly higher frequency of postoperative anterior STS difference > 5 mm compared with revision ACLR (8.4 vs 5.0%; P = 0.02). The KOOS was available for primary and revision ACLR for 73 patients (55.4% males; mean age at primary ACLR 21.6 ± 7 years and revision ACLR 24.7 ± 7.3 years). Preoperatively, revision ACLR showed significantly higher scores in all KOOS subscales, except for the activity of daily living (ADL) subscale. For the primary ACLR, the improvement from preoperatively to the 1-year follow-up was significantly greater in all KOOS subscales and, the postoperative scores were superior for Pain, ADL and Sports subscales compared with revision ACLR. The findings of this study showed that anterior knee laxity is restored with revision BPTB autograft ACLR after failed primary HT autograft ACLR, in the same cohort of patients. However, revision ACLR showed a significantly inferior functional knee outcome compared with primary ACLR. It is important for clinicians to inform and set realistic expectations for patients undergoing revision ACLR. Patients must be aware of the fact that having revision ACLR their knee function will not improve as much as with primary ACLR and the final postoperative functional outcome is inferior. Retrospective cohort study, Level III.

TI  - Anatomical Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Hamstring Tendon Autografts: A Comparative Study of Three Different Techniques
PY  - 2020
AB  - The ideal procedure for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is one that can achieve anatomical restoration for a better ACL function. This retrospective comparative study was conducted to evaluate the objective and subjective clinical results of the conventional single-bundle femoral round (SBR) tunnel technique, the single-bundle femoral oval (SBO) tunnel technique, and the double-bundle (DB) surgical technique for anatomical ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autografts. Patients who underwent the SBO, SBR, and DB ACL reconstructions from January 2016 to August 2017 were included in this study. A total of 163 patients underwent different surgical techniques; 41 patients underwent the SBO procedure, 78 patients received SBR, and the remaining 44 patients underwent the DB procedure. The Lachman's test, pivot-shift test, Lysholm's score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner's score were compared among groups postoperatively. KT-1000 was used to measure the anterior laxity of the knee. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare the ACL graft maturity. Second-look arthroscopy was conducted to compare the graft status and synovial coverage. Significant differences among groups were found with respect to the Lysholm's score, Tegner's score, and IKDC score. Patients in the SBO and DB groups acquired higher functional scores than the SBR group. More patients with positive pivot-shift test were observed in the SBR group than other groups at 12- and 24-month postoperative follow-ups. The postoperative KT-1000 was better in the SBO and DB groups than in the SBR group. The mean signal/noise quotient (SNQ) of the SBO group was 2.70 ± 0.92, significantly lower than 3.58 ± 1.21 of the SBR group. Despite a higher proportion of patients with grade B or C synovial coverage and partial graft injury found in the SBR group, there were no significant differences among the groups. The SBO and DB technique achieved better clinical results than the SBR technique. The SBO technique was indeed an ideal surgical procedure for ACL reconstruction provided that the shortcoming of DB technique must be taken into account. This is a Level III, retrospective comparative study.

TI  - The effect of initiating a preventive multimodal analgesic regimen on long-term patient outcomes for outpatient anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery.
PY  - 2007
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unrelieved postoperative pain may impair rehabilitation, delay recovery, and result in poor outcomes. Preventive multimodal analgesic techniques may improve long-term outcome after surgery. METHODS: We randomized 200 consecutive patients to receive acetaminophen 1000 mg and either celecoxib 400 mg or placebo 1-2 h before anterior cruciate ligament surgery. All patients received intraarticular analgesics and had an external cooling system applied to the operative knee. After discharge patients were instructed to take acetaminophen 1000 mg every 6 h and either celecoxib 200 mg every 12 h or matching placebo for the first 14 days postoperatively. All patients were enrolled in an accelerated rehabilitation program. Six months postoperatively, the level of activity was assessed, as was the presence of patellofemoral complications including: anterior knee pain, flexion contracture, quadriceps weakness, and complex regional pain syndrome. RESULTS: More patients in the control group developed patellofemoral complications compared to the celecoxib group (P = 0.001) including anterior knee pain (14/96; 15%) vs (4/95; 1%), complex regional pain syndrome (7/96; 7%) vs (1/95; 1%), flexion contractures (9/96; 9%) vs (2/95; 2%), and scar tissue requiring re-arthroscopy (8/96; 8%) vs (2/95; 2%) respectively. More patients in the celecoxib group returned to a higher activity level (84% vs 65%) (P < 0.01), were able to participate at a more intense level (P < 0.02), and return to full sports activity (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The administration of celecoxib as a component of a preventive multimodal analgesic technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction reduces long-term patellofemoral complications and increases the likelihood of returning to a preinjury level of activity.

TI  - The effect of graft choice on functional outcome in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2007
AB  - A prospective, randomised, 5-year follow-up study was designed to compare the functional results between patellar tendon and hamstring tendon autografts after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Primary reconstruction was performed in 32 patients using the central third of the patellar ligament and in 32 patients using double-looped semitendinosus and gracilis tendons. All reconstructions were performed by a single surgeon, with identical surgical technique and rehabilitation protocol. Of the total 64 patients in the study, 54 (85%) were available for the 5-year follow-up. No statistically significant differences were seen with respect to Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) classification, clinical and KT-2000 arthrometer laxity testing, single-legged hop test and anterior knee pain. Graft rupture occurred in two patients (8%) in the patellar tendon group and in two patients (7%) in the hamstring tendon group; 23 patients (88%) in the patellar tendon group and 23 patients (82%) in the hamstring tendon group returned to their pre-injury activity level. Good subjective outcome and stability can be obtained by using either graft; no statistically significant differences were found in functional outcome between the grafts.

TI  - Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis Reduces Rotational Laxity When Combined With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review of the Literature
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose To determine whether the addition of lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction would provide greater control of rotational laxity and improved clinical outcomes compared with ACL reconstruction alone. Methods Two independent reviewers searched 9 databases for randomized and nonrandomized clinical studies comparing ACL reconstruction plus LET versus ACL reconstruction alone in a human adult population. All years and 5 languages were included. Animal and cadaveric studies, revision or repair surgical techniques, and studies focused on biomechanical outcomes were excluded. Quality assessment of the included studies was performed with the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Outcomes of interest included the pivot-shift test, KT-1000/-2000 measurements (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and International Knee Documentation Committee scores. Results The literature search yielded 3,612 articles. After titles and abstracts were reviewed, 106 articles were selected for full-text review, of which 29 studies met the inclusion criteria (8 randomized and 21 nonrandomized studies). Of the 8 randomized studies, 3 concluded that the results were nonsignificant between treatment groups, 4 were in favor of the extra-articular tenodesis, and 1 was in favor of the ACL reconstruction alone. The Cochrane Collaboration tool showed an unclear to high risk of bias for most articles. A meta-analysis showed a statistically significant difference for the pivot-shift test ( P  = .002, I 2  = 34%) in favor of ACL reconstruction with LET. No difference was found between the groups for International Knee Documentation Committee scores ( P  = .75, I 2  = 19%) and KT-1000/-2000 measurements ( P  = .84, I 2  = 34%). Conclusions Meta-analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in pivot shift in favor of the combined procedure. Studies lacked sufficient internal validity, sample size, methodologic consistency, and standardization of protocols and outcomes. Level of Evidence Level III, systematic review of Level I, II, and III studies.

TI  - Short-term recovery of physical activity and knee function after an acute knee injury.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Objectives To describe self-reported knee function, participation in physical activity and the number of knee surgeries at 3 and 6 months following acute knee injury. Methods Prospective cohort study. Participants, aged 15–40 years with an acute knee injury sustained no more than 6 weeks prior to inclusion, were recruited. There were 279 participants with ACL injury and 101 participants with other acute knee injuries included. Follow-up questionnaires were sent at 3 and 6 months after injury. Demographic information, activity participation, International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form (IKDC-SKF) and the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) score were collected. Additional knee injuries were obtained from self-report and medical charts. Results The IKDC-SKF, SANE and physical activity participation were reduced at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. The number of participants who achieved health-promoting physical activity levels was reduced by 50% at 6-month follow-up compared with before injury. Seventeen per cent of participants with ACL injury and 41% of participants with other acute knee injuries had returned to their preinjury physical activity at 6 months. Participants with ACL injury reported worse knee function, lower physical activity participation and had more surgeries (128 surgeries, including 109 ACL-reconstructions) compared with participants with other acute knee injuries (six surgeries). Conclusion Acute knee injuries, including ACL injuries, affected self-reported knee function and physical activity participation for at least 6 months after index injury. More research is needed to understand how best to help people with acute knee injuries return to physical activity and achieve satisfactory knee function.

TI  - Successful return to sports in athletes following non-operative management of acute isolated posterior cruciate ligament injuries: medium-term follow-up
PY  - 2017
AB  - Aims The aim of this study was to report the outcome of the non-operative
treatment of high-grade posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries,
particularly Hughston grade III injuries, which have not previously
been described. Patients and Methods This was a prospective study involving 46 consecutive patients
who were athletes with MRI-confirmed isolated PCL injuries presenting
within four weeks of injury. All had Hughston grade II (25 athletes)
or III (21 athletes) injuries. Our non-operative treatment regimen
involved initial bracing, followed by an individualised rehabilitation
programme determined by the symptoms and physical signs. The patients
were reviewed until they had returned to sports-specific training,
and were reviewed again at a mean of 5.2 years (3 to 9). Results The mean time to return to sports-specific training was 10.6
weeks and the mean time to return to full competitive sport was
16.4 weeks (10 to 40). A total of 42 patients (91.3%) were playing
at the same or higher level of sport two years after the injury,
with a mean Tegner activity score of 9 (5 to 10). At five years,
32 patients (69.5%) were playing at the same or higher level of
sport, and 38 patients (82.6%) were playing at a competitive level,
with a mean Tegner activity score of 9 (5 to 10). Conclusions Medium-term review of a series of athletes suggests that commencing
the non-operative management of isolated, Hughston grade II and
III PCL injuries within four weeks of injury gives excellent functional
outcomes with a high proportion returning to the same or higher level
of sport. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2017;99-B:774–8.

TI  - Concurrent validity of the single assessment numerical evaluation and patient-reported functional measures in patients with musculoskeletal disorders: An observational study.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Introduction As patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) continue to evolve as vital measures of patient status, it may be useful to identify efficiently, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) scores that are valid and related to the patient's specific functional needs. Objective To evaluate the concurrent validity between SANE scores and commonly used body region-specific functional PROMs, functional percentage change scores, and total visits in patients with musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders. Methods 479 patients completed the SANE and one of the following PROMs at physical therapy discharge: Modified Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire [MDQ], Neck Disability Index [NDI], Penn Shoulder Score [PSS], International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC], Lower Extremity Functional Scale [LEFS]. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between SANE and the aforementioned outcomes and total visits. Results The SANE was moderately negatively correlated with the MDQ and NDI at discharge. There were high positive correlations between SANE and PSS and IKDC and moderate positive correlation between SANE and LEFS. The SANE and MDQ and IKDQ demonstrated low positive correlation for functional percentage change scores, and the SANE and NDI demonstrated moderate positive correlation for functional percentage change scores. For total visits outcome, there was a negligible negative correlation between SANE and MDQ and NDI at discharge. Conclusion The SANE exhibits acceptable concurrent validity across all investigated PROMs at physical therapy discharge. However, inconsistent relationships across body regions for functional percentage change and total visits suggest differences in these values as compared to raw discharge scores.

TI  - Intercondylar eminence avulsion fracture in children: long-term follow-up of 14 cases at the end of skeletal growth.
PY  - 2010
AB  - The purpose of this study was to report the long-term clinical outcome in a group of 14 patients treated for an avulsion fracture of the tibial spine. On the basis of the Meyers and McKeever classification, there were four type I avulsions, three type II and seven type III. Seven patients were treated nonoperatively and seven patients were operated according to one of the two different protocols: open reduction and internal fixation and arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation. At follow-up, four patients had clinical signs of joint instability, but no subjective instability. One patient with a type III lesion treated nonsurgically showed severe instability. All other patients returned to the same sport activity level that they had had before the fracture. We obtained good results in 13 out of 14 cases. Good results can be obtained when type I fractures are treated nonoperatively. Type II and type III lesions showed better results after arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation. Nonabsorbable suture fixation for osteosynthesis is recommended. The prognosis is strictly related to the type of fracture, anatomic reduction and articular congruity.

TI  - 3D High-Frequency Ultrasound Imaging of Cartilage-Bone Interface Compared with Micro-CT.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Cartilage-bone interface (CBI) is a complex structure which bears important information in pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA). While high-frequency ultrasound (US) has been widely used for the investigation of articular cartilage, 3D imaging of CBI using US is less commonly reported in this field. Here, we adopted a 3D high-frequency ultrasound imaging approach specifically for the investigation of CBI in human knee samples. Fifteen osteochondral disks from the tibial plateau of seven OA patients were prepared in vitro and scanned using both high-frequency US and micro-CT imaging. The 3D morphology of the tidemark was reconstructed and compared using an image registration approach between the two imaging modalities. Results showed that the 3D tidemark could be well registered between the two imaging methods with a mean surface discrepancy of . Quantitative surface waviness/roughness parameter analysis showed significant correlations between the two imaging modalities. An intensity projected en face imaging was proposed to probe characteristic details of the CBI such as its perforations. This study provided evidence for the 3D high-frequency ultrasound as a nonionizing radiation imaging tool potentially useful to evaluate the change of CBI in basic research of join diseases including OA.

TI  - Knee stability, athletic performance and sport-specific tasks in non-professional soccer players after ACL reconstruction: comparing trans-tibial and antero-medial portal techniques.
PY  - 2015
AB  - BACKGROUND a wrong position of bone tunnels, in particular on the femur, is one of the most frequent causes of a failed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Several studies demonstrated that drilling the femoral tunnel through the antero-medial portal (AMP) allows a more anatomical placement on the lateral femoral condyle and higher knee stability, compared to trans-tibial (TT) technique. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate two groups of soccer players operated on for ACL reconstruction according to either one of these two techniques. METHODS two groups of non-professional soccer players operated on for a single bundle ACL reconstruction with hamstrings autograft using either a TT (20 patients) or an AMP (23 patients) technique were retrospectively evaluated with KT-1000 arthrometer, manual pivot shift test, isokinetic test, the incremental treadmill-running test, athletic and sport specific tasks, and knee scores (IKDC, Lysholm and KOOS). RESULTS the AMP group showed better results at pivot shift test and KOOS, but lower flexion angles at single leg squat test. There were no differences in all the other considered outcomes. CONCLUSIONS the better rotational stability of the knee achieved in AMP group did not lead to significantly better clinical and functional results in our patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE III TREATMENT STUDY Case-control study.

TI  - Comparison of quantitative evaluation between cutaneous and transosseous inertial sensors in anterior cruciate ligament deficient knee: A cadaveric study
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Background Recently several authors have reported on the quantitative evaluation of the pivot-shift test using cutaneous fixation of inertial sensors. Before utilizing this sensor for clinical studies, it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of cutaneous sensor in assessing rotational knee instability. To evaluate the accuracy of inertial sensors, we compared cutaneous and transosseous sensors in the quantitative assessment of rotational knee instability in a cadaveric setting, in order to demonstrate their clinical applicability. Methods Eight freshly frozen human cadaveric knees were used in this study. Inertial sensors were fixed on the tibial tuberosity and directly fixed to the distal tibia bone. A single examiner performed the pivot shift test from flexion to extension on the intact knees and ACL deficient knees. The peak overall magnitude of acceleration and the maximum rotational angular velocity in the tibial superoinferior axis was repeatedly measured with the inertial sensor during the pivot shift test. Correlations between cutaneous and transosseous inertial sensors were evaluated, as well as statistical analysis for differences between ACL intact and ACL deficient knees. Results Acceleration and angular velocity measured with the cutaneous sensor demonstrated a strong positive correlation with the transosseous sensor (r = 0.86 and r = 0.83). Comparison between cutaneous and transosseous sensor indicated significant difference for the peak overall magnitude of acceleration (cutaneous: 10.3 ± 5.2 m/s2, transosseous: 14.3 ± 7.6 m/s2, P  Conclusions There is a positive correlation between cutaneous and transosseous inertial sensors. Therefore, this study indicated that the cutaneous inertial sensors could be used clinically for quantifying rotational knee instability, irrespective of the location of utilization.

TI  - Prevalence and Predictors of Concomitant Meniscal and Ligamentous Injuries Associated With ACL Surgery: An Analysis of 20 Years of ACL Reconstruction at a Tertiary Care Children's Hospital.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">There is an increasing rate of procedures being performed for concomitant injuries during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery. Few studies have examined risk factors for these associated injuries in young patients.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="HYPOTHESIS">There are patient-related factors predictive of concomitant knee pathology that differ between age-based cohorts.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN">Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">Natural language processing was used to extract clinical variables from available notes of patients undergoing ACL surgery between 2000 and 2020 at a single institution (5174 ACL surgeries; mean age, 17 ± 4 years; 53.1% female; accuracy, &gt;98%). Patients were stratified to pediatric (5-13 years), adolescent (14-19 years), and young adult (20-35 years) cohorts. Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of concomitant injury to the menisci, medial collateral ligament (MCL), posterolateral corner (PLC), and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Between 2000 and 2020, 54% of pediatric, 71% of adolescent, and 70% of adult patients had ≥1 concomitant soft tissue injury. In children and adolescents, increased age was consistently predictive of sustaining a concomitant injury (<i>P</i> &lt; .02). Female children had increased odds of concomitant medial meniscal injury, while female adults had decreased odds (<i>P</i>≤ .046). Adolescent and adult female patients had decreased odds of concomitant lateral meniscal injury (<i>P</i>≤ .027). Female children had increased odds of injury to the MCL (<i>P</i> = .015), whereas female children and adolescents had decreased odds of PCL injury (<i>P</i>≤ .044). Adolescents undergoing revision ACL surgery had increased odds of meniscal injury (<i>P</i>≤ .001) and decreased odds of concomitant MCL injury (<i>P</i> = .028). Increased body mass index (BMI) was associated with increased odds of concomitant medial meniscal injury in all cohorts (<i>P</i>≤ .041), lateral meniscal injury in adults (<i>P</i> = .045), and PLC injury in children (<i>P</i> = .016). Contact injuries were associated with increased odds of MCL injury in adolescents (<i>P</i> = .017) and PLC injury in adolescents and adults (<i>P</i> &lt; .014).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">These findings support the hypothesis, as there were multiple factors that significantly affected the risk of concomitant injuries that differed between cohorts. Increased age, BMI, and contact injury history were generally associated with increased odds of sustaining a concomitant injury, whereas female sex and revision ACL surgery had mixed effects. Further studies are essential to investigate the sex-based differences in risk for concomitant injuries and to develop tailored treatment plans that minimize the risk of secondary ACL injury.</AbstractText>

TI  - The outcome at ten years of lateral closing-wedge high tibial osteotomy Determinants of survival and functional outcome
PY  - 2014
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the functional
outcome at ten years following lateral closing wedge high tibial osteotomy
for medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee and to define
pre-operative predictors of survival and determinants of functional
outcome. 164 consecutive patients underwent high tibial osteotomy between
2000 and 2002. A total of 100 patients (100 knees) met the inclusion
criteria and 95 were available for review at ten years. Data were
collected prospectively and included patient demographics, surgical
details, long leg alignment radiographs, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) and Knee Society scores (KSS) pre-operatively
and at five and ten years follow-up. At ten years, 21 patients had been revised at a mean of five
years. Overall Kaplan–Meier survival was 87% (95% confidence interval
(CI) 81 to 94) and 79% (95% CI 71 to 87) at five and ten years,
respectively. When compared with unrevised patients, those who had
been revised had significantly lower mean pre-operative WOMAC Scores
(47 (21 to 85) vs 65 (32 to 99), p < 0.001),
higher mean age (54 yrs (42 to 61) vs 49 yrs (26
to 66), p = 0.006) and a higher mean BMI (30.2; 25 to 39 vs 27.9;
21 to 36, p = 0.005). Each were found to be risk factors for revision,
with hazard ratios of 10.7 (95% CI 4 to 28.6; pre-operative WOMAC
 55) and 3.0 (95%CI 1.2
to 7.6; BMI > 30). Survival of patients with pre-operative WOMAC
> 45, age < 55 and BMI < 30 was 97% at five and ten years. WOMAC
and KSS in surviving patients improved significantly between pre-operative
(mean 61; 32 to 99) and five (mean 88; 35 to 100, p = 0.001) and
ten years (mean 84; 38 to 100, p = 0.001). Older patients had better
functional outcomes overall, despite their higher revision rate. This study has shown that improved survival is associated with
age 45 and, a BMI <
30. In patients over 55 years of age with adequate pre-operative
functional scores, survival can be good and functional outcomes
can be significantly better than their younger counterparts. We
recommend the routine use of pre-operative functional outcome scores
to guide decision-making when considering suitability for high tibial osteotomy. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2014;96-B:1491–7.

TI  - Comparative Study on Immediate Versus Delayed Meniscus Allograft Transplantation 4- to 6-Year Follow-up
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background:Meniscus allograft transplantation (MAT) is generally used for patients who sustain symptoms after meniscectomy, which could be called delayed MAT. Meniscus allograft transplantation for patients immediately after meniscectomy has not been reported.Hypothesis:Compared with the conventional delayed MAT, immediate MAT might provide better clinical results and reduce joint degeneration.Study Design:Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:The study was performed with 18 transplanted menisci (6 medial, 12 lateral) from 16 patients. Eight menisci were transplanted immediately after meniscectomy (IM group); 10 menisci, from patients who complained of knee symptoms at a mean time of 35 months (range, 9-92 months) after total meniscectomy, underwent delayed transplantation (DE group). Fourteen patients undergoing meniscectomy during the same period were included as controls (ME group). Degenerative changes in knee joints were evaluated by plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Allogr...

TI  - Surgical treatment of posterior cruciate ligament lesions does not cause growth disturbances in pediatric patients
PY  - 2018
AB  - The aim of the present study was to describe epidemiology, management and outcome of pediatric and adolescent patients with posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries. Sixteen patients of less than 18 years of age with 7 PCL avulsion fractures and 9 PCL tears were included over a 10-year period. Trauma mechanism, additional injuries and treatment methods were analyzed. Follow-up examination included range of motion and ability to perform squats. Pedi-IKDC and Lysholm score were obtained and posterior shift was measured in kneeling view radiographs and compared to the contralateral side. Patients were grouped into pediatric patients with open physes at the time surgery and adolescent patients with closing or closed physes. In case of open physes, growth disturbances were assessed. Six of the treated patients (median age 12.5 years, range 10–13) had open physes at time of surgery. Five of those sustained avulsion fractures and treatment consisted of open reduction and screw fixation in four cases and graft reconstruction in one case. One patient sustained a PCL tear and underwent graft reconstruction. Follow-up at a median of 71.5 months (range 62–100) did not reveal any growth disturbances. Median Pedi-IKDC was 71.9 (range 51.7–92.1), median Lysholm score was 81.5 (range 66–88) and median posterior shift difference was 2.5 mm (range 0–11). The remaining 10 patients (median age 16 years, range 14–17) had closing/closed physis at the time of operation. Two patients presented with avulsion fractures treated with open reduction and screw fixation and 8 patients sustained PCL tears treated with graft reconstruction. At a median follow-up of 69.5 months (range 11–112), median Pedi-IKDC was 86.8 (range 36.8–97.7), median Lysholm score was 84.0 (range 45–95) and median posterior shift difference was 4 mm (range 0–15). In our small number of pediatric patients with PCL injuries, open reduction and epiphyseal screw fixation of displaced avulsed fractures and steep tunnel drilling in case of PCL reconstruction did not cause growth disturbances. Nevertheless, long-term functional impairment should be expected and close follow-up has to be recommended. Therapeutic, Level IV.

TI  - Factors Associated With Return to Sport and Reinjury in Athletes After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis
PY  - 2024
AB  - <jats:p> OBJECTIVE: To identify which performance-based and patient-reported measures of physical function predict return to sport (RTS) and reinjury after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). </jats:p><jats:p> DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis. </jats:p><jats:p> LITERATURE SEARCH: Medline (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), and Embase (Elsevier) were searched. </jats:p><jats:p> STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Observational or randomized controlled trials investigating performance-based and/or patient-reported measures of function after ACLR in athletes playing level I and II sports with at least 100 hours of sports per year with follow-up to determine RTS or reinjury. </jats:p><jats:p> DATA SYNTHESIS: The MINORS (Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies) scale assessed risk of bias. Effect sizes were calculated as Hedge’s g for continuous data and odds ratios for proportions. Random-effects meta-analyses estimated pooled standardized mean differences. Heterogeneity was investigated with the I<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> statistic. </jats:p><jats:p> RESULTS: Seven studies were included with 584 athletes. Lower extremity strength was a common predictor of reinjury. Strength, hop tests, movement quality assessment, and preinjury activity level predicted RTS in individual studies; there were no measures that consistently predicted RTS. Four studies reported a relationship between reinjury and passing a battery of strength and performance-based measures, but the majority of measures were not predictors of reinjury. Pooled effect sizes were significant for individual limb performance of the side hop between those who returned to preinjury level of sport and those who did not (Hedge’s g, ipsilateral side: 0.42 [95% confidence interval: 0.06, 0.78]; contralateral side: 0.46 [95% confidence interval: 0.13, 0.78]). </jats:p><jats:p> CONCLUSION: We cannot recommend specific RTS tests that predict reinjury in highly active athletes. There was limited evidence for a relationship between side hop performance and return to preinjury sport. JOSPT Open 2024;2(1):8-19. Epub 4 December 2023. doi:10.2519/josptopen.2023.0503 </jats:p>

TI  - Platelet rich plasma use in allograft ACL reconstructions: two-year clinical results of a MOON cohort study.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Abstract Background Platelet rich plasma has been promoted as a biologic agent to enhance tissue healing. As a concentration of autologous growth factors, it has gained increased use in musculoskeletal applications. Methods The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of intra-operative PRP on patient-reported outcomes 2 years after ACL reconstruction with tibialis anterior allograft. Fifty patients who underwent allograft ACL reconstruction with intra-operative application of PRP to the graft were matched with 50 allograft ACL -reconstructions without PRP use. The same surgeon performed all procedures with identical technique. Two year patient-reported outcomes including KOOS, IKDC, and Marx activity scores were obtained. Effusions in the immediate post-operative period, post-operative complications, and any subsequent procedures were also recorded. Results There was no difference between the groups with respect to additional surgeries or complications in the first 2 years after reconstruction. Decreased effusions at 10 ± 4 days were noted in the PRP group, but this difference disappeared by 8 ± 4 weeks. No differences in patient-reported outcomes were noted in the 58 patients with two-year outcome data. Conclusion The study demonstrated that although PRP application in tibialis allograft ACL reconstructions appeared safe; clinical benefit was minor and short-term. No differences in patient-reported outcomes or number of additional surgeries at 2 years were noted. Level of evidence Level III — retrospective comparative study.

AB  - Correlation between histological analysis and functional evaluation of the knees of patients undergoing reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament Objective: This study investigated the relationship between range of motion and the histological analysis of the synovium of the knee joint following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Method: Histological, pain and range-of-motion (ROM) evaluations were performed on the knees of 26 patients. The Shapiro-Wilk test, Friedman test and Spearman correlation coefficient were utilized for verifying the existence of significant correlations between the variables, using the SPSS for Windows 12.0 statistical software with a significance level of 5%. Results: Comparing before and after the operation, statistical differences were found in relation to knee extension ROM (p= 0.042), flexion ROM (p= 0.001) and hyperextension (p= 0.001). There were also significant correlations between the subsynovial tissue and the flexion ROM of the operated knees (r= 0.53; p= 0.008), between the subsynovial tissue and the sensation of pain (r= 0.46; p= 0.024), and between the extension ROM after the operation and type I collagen (r= 0.52; p= 0.016). Conclusion: The greater the quantity of type I collagen observed, the thicker was the subsynovial tissue, the greater the reported pain, and the less was the ROM of the operated knees.

TI  - Age, time from injury to surgery and quadriceps strength affect the risk of revision surgery after primary ACL reconstruction
PY  - 2021
AB  - To identify preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative factors associated with revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) within 2 years of primary ACLR. Patients who underwent primary ACLR at our institution, from January 2005 to March 2017, were identified. The primary outcome was the occurrence of revision ACLR within 2 years of primary ACLR. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate preoperative [age, gender, body mass index (BMI), time from injury to surgery, pre-injury Tegner activity level], intraoperative [graft type, graft diameter, medial meniscus (MM) and lateral meniscus (LM) resection or repair, cartilage injury] and postoperative [side-to-side (STS) anterior laxity, limb symmetry index (LSI) for quadriceps and hamstring strength and single-leg-hop test performance at 6 months] risk factors for revision ACLR. A total of 6,510 primary ACLRs were included. The overall incidence of revision ACLR within 2 years was 2.5%. Univariate analysis showed that age   5 mm, quadriceps strength and single-leg-hop test LSI of ≥ 90% increased the odds; whereas, MM resection and the presence of a cartilage injury reduced the odds of revision ACLR. Multivariate analysis revealed that revision ACLR was significantly related only to age < 25 years (OR 6.25; 95% CI 3.57–11.11; P < 0.001), time from injury to surgery < 12 months (OR 2.27; 95% CI 1.25–4.17; P = 0.007) and quadriceps strength LSI of ≥ 90% (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.16–2.49; P = 0.006). Age < 25 years, time from injury to surgery < 12 months and 6-month quadriceps strength LSI of ≥ 90% increased the odds of revision ACLR within 2 years of primary ACLR. Understanding the risk factors for revision ACLR has important implications when it comes to the appropriate counseling for primary ACLR. In this study, a large spectrum of potential risk factors for revision ACLR was analyzed in a large cohort. Advising patients regarding the results of an ACLR should also include potential risk factors for revision surgery. III.

TI  - The effect of anterior cruciate ligament surgery on bone mineral in the calcaneus: a prospective study with a 2-year follow-up evaluation.
PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract Purpose: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction on the bone mineral area mass (BMA) in the calcaneus on the injured and noninjured sides. Type of Study: A prospective cohort study with sequential assessments of bone mineral in the calcaneus before and after ACL reconstruction. Methods: Thirty-four consecutive patients with a unilateral ACL rupture underwent arthroscopic reconstruction using patellar tendon autografts. The BMA was assessed bilaterally in the calcaneus using a gamma camera according to the dual-energy photon absorptiometry technique, before surgery and after 6 and 26 months. Results: Thirty-one of 34 patients (20 men and 11 women) underwent all BMA measurements. The median age at index surgery was 27 (16 to 50) years, and the reconstruction was performed 12 (2 to 192) months after the injury. The median preoperative Tegner activity level increased from 3 (2 to 8) to 7 (2 to 9) at 26 months ( P P = .0014; P = .0006). On all occasions, the BMA was lower on the injured side than on the noninjured side ( P = .012). Conclusions: Patients with a unilateral ACL rupture had a lower BMA in the calcaneus on the injured side compared with the noninjured side. Although patients increased activity levels after reconstruction, the BMA in the calcaneus decreased on both the injured and the noninjured side up to 2 years after surgery. Level of Evidence: Level II-1, prospective cohort study.

TI  - A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel-Group, Placebo-Controlled Study Evaluating Meniscal Healing, Clinical Outcomes, and Safety in Patients Undergoing Meniscal Repair of Unstable, Complete Vertical Meniscal Tears (Bucket Handle) Augmented with Platelet-Rich Plasma.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Objective. The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) application in arthroscopic repair of complete vertical tear of meniscus located in the red-white zone. Methods. This single center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study included 37 patients with complete vertical meniscus tears. Patients received an intrarepair site injection of either PRP or sterile 0.9% saline during an index arthroscopy. The primary endpoint was the rate of meniscus healing in the two groups. The secondary endpoints were changes in the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and analog scale (VAS) in the two groups at 42 months. Results. After 18 weeks, the meniscus healing rate was significantly higher in the PRP-treated group than in the control group (85% versus 47%, ). Functional outcomes were significantly better 42 months after treatment than at baseline in both groups. The IKDC score, WOMAC, and KOOS were significantly better in the PRP-treated group than in the control group. No adverse events were reported during the study period. Conclusions. The findings of this study indicate that PRP augmentation in meniscus repair results in improvements in both meniscus healing and functional outcome.

TI  - Symptomatic anterior cruciate ligament tears treated with percutaneous injection of autologous bone marrow concentrate and platelet products: a non-controlled registry study
PY  - 2018
AB  - Bone marrow concentrate (BMC) has shown promise in the treatment of several orthopedic conditions. This registry study investigated the use of autologous BMC and platelet products for percutaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) treatment. Twenty-nine patients presenting to a single outpatient interventional musculoskeletal and pain practice with symptomatic grade 1, 2, or 3 ACL tears with less than 1 cm retraction were enrolled. Patients were treated with a percutaneous ACL injection of autologous BMC and platelet products using fluoroscopic guidance. Pre- and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging analysis was completed for 23 patients using ImageJ software for an objective quantitative analysis of pixel density as a proxy for ACL integrity. Subjective clinical outcome measures collected pre-treatment and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months post-treatment include the Numerical Pain Scale (NPS), the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, and a modified version of the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation. Seventy-seven percent of patients treated with BMC injections into the ACL showed significant improvement (p < 0.01) in objective measures of ACL integrity at an average of 8.8 months (median 4.7 months). The mean of last patient-reported improvement was 72% (SD = 35) at an average of 23 (SD = 10) months post-treatment. Mean scores were found to be significantly different (p < 0.05) for the NPS at 6, 18, and 24 months, and LEFS and IKDC at all time points (i.e. 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months) relative to baseline. In symptomatic patients with grade 1, 2, or even grade 3 tears with minimal retraction, ACL treatment with percutaneous injection of BMC and platelet products shows promise as a non-surgical alternative. However, a larger randomized controlled trial is warranted to confirm these findings. Trial registration NCT03011398.

TI  - Rehabilitation Before and After Total Knee Arthroplasty
PY  - 2004
AB  - Rehabilitation programs are as important in the overall success of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) as surgical technique and implant design. However, most rehabilitation protocols are based on empirical guidelines rather than on scientific facts and are seldom supervised by the surgeon. As a result, the variety of recommended programs is large and confusing in content, ranging from unsupervised walking to complete instruction in functional activities and specific exercises. Popular programs include active and passive range of motion (ROM) exercises, continuous passive motion (CPM) and isometric quadriceps strengthening.

TI  - Clinical diagnosis of an anterior cruciate ligament rupture: A meta-analysis
PY  - 2006
AB  - Study Design Meta-analysis. Objectives To define the accuracy of clinical tests for assessing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures. Background The cruciate ligaments, and especially the ACL, are among the most commonly injured structures of the knee. Given the increasing injury prevalence, there is undoubtedly a growing need for clinical decision making of health care providers. We reviewed the literature to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical examination for assessing ACL ruptures. Methods and Measures MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1989 to April 2005), and CINAHL (1982 to April 2005) searches were performed. Also reference lists of the included studies were reviewed. Studies selected for data extraction were those that addressed the accuracy of at least 1 physical diagnostic test for ACL rupture and compared the performance of the clinical examination of the knee with a reference standard, such as arthroscopy, arthrotomy, or MRI. Searching was limited to English, German, and Dutc...

TI  - The effect of early motion on tibial tunnel widening after anterior cruciate ligament replacement using hamstring tendon grafts.
PY  - 2004
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that early motion increases tibial tunnel enlargement in patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) replacement with hamstring autograft. Type of Study: Cohort analytic study. Methods: All patients in this study had received a doubled semitendinous and gracilis graft. Grafts were secured in place with an implant– free technique. Two groups of patients were evaluated. Group A consisted of 35 patients who underwent isolated ACL replacement and whose rehabilitation protocol included early motion. Group B consisted of 20 patients who underwent combined arthroscopic meniscal repair and ACL replacement. Partial weight bearing and restriction of range of motion for 6 weeks was recommended for these patients. The only 2 variables between the groups were the meniscal repair and the postoperative rehabilitation. Patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. After correction for radiographic magnification, the tibial tunnel was measured at distal (T1), middle (T2), and proximal (T3) locations on both anteroposterior and lateral views. Results: At 1-year follow-up evaluations, tunnel enlargement was significantly higher in the group with early motion, in both the anteroposterior and lateral views, in all but one location (anteroposterior, T1). The enlargement was greater in the mid-portion (T2) of the tunnel in both groups. The mean percentage was 45.92% for group A and 23.34% for group B (P .05) in the anteroposterior view, and 48.14% for group A and 24.47% for group B (P .05) in the lateral view. No correlation was found between tunnel enlargement and clinical results or between tunnel enlargement and joint laxity measured by a KT-1000 arthrometer. Conclusions: Our study confirms that early motion increases the amount of tibial tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament replacement with hamstring autograft. This may have an impact on future rehabilitation protocols. Level of Evidence: Level II. Key Words: Tibial tunnel enlargement—ACL reconstruction—Hamstring autograft.

TI  - Effect of Meniscal Tear Patterns and Preoperative Cartilage Status on Joint Space Width After Medial Opening-Wedge High Tibial Osteotomy.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Medial opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy (MOWHTO) is performed to treat young adults with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis associated with varus deformity. However, factors influencing joint space width (JSW) vary according to the type of medial meniscal tear and have not yet been completely elucidated.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To examine changes in JSW according to the type of medial meniscal tear after MOWHTO and analyze the influencing factors.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This study was conducted on 134 patients who underwent MOWHTO for medial osteoarthritis and were followed up for &gt;2 years. The patients were classified into 3 groups based on medial meniscal status: intact, nonroot tear, and root tear. The authors then measured the JSW preoperatively and at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and &gt;2 years postoperatively; analyzed whether the change in JSW varied according to meniscal status; and determined the association of these changes with the preoperative cartilage grade of the medial femoral condyle (MFC) and medial tibial plateau (MTP). International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were used to evaluate clinical function.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Of the 134 patients, the medial meniscus was intact in 29 patients, a nonroot tear was observed in 58 patients, and a root tear was observed in 47 patients. Postoperatively, JSW increased for all groups, but the timing of the increase varied between the groups (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). JSW increased the most 6 months postoperatively in the intact group and 3 months postoperatively in the nonroot tear and root tear groups (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Additionally, the increase in JSW was the greatest in the root tear group. Preoperatively, MFC and MTP cartilage status differed among the groups; MTP status did not affect the JSW, but MFC status did (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). The IKDC score increased from the preoperative to postoperative time point in all groups, but there was no significant difference between groups.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The authors observed that the amount and timing of increase in JSW were dependent on the pattern of medial meniscal tear observed when MOWHTO was performed. In addition, the cartilage grade of MFC before surgery was associated with changes in JSW. The IKDC score was not significantly different between groups. However, a longer follow-up period is needed to analyze the correlation with the meniscal tear pattern and JSW.</AbstractText>

TI  - Arthroscopic Meniscus Allograft Transplantation in Male Professional Soccer Players A 36-Month Follow-up Study
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background:Meniscus allograft transplantation (MAT) is an option for symptomatic patients who have undergone subtotal meniscectomy and can potentially result in pain relief and increased function.Hypothesis:Professional soccer players would benefit from arthroscopic MAT in terms of pain, knee function, and return to play at 36-month follow-up.Study Design:Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Methods:Twelve male patients who had undergone MAT (6 medial, 6 lateral) were prospectively evaluated at 12- and 36-month follow-up. The mean age at the time of surgery was 24.5 ± 3.6 years (range, 19-29 years), and the mean time from meniscectomy to surgery was 37 ± 31 months (range, 2-82 months). The transplantation was performed in patients who had undergone subtotal meniscectomy using an arthroscopic bone plug–free technique with a single tibial tunnel plus “all-inside” meniscus sutures. The anterior horn of the transplanted meniscus was sutured to the capsule and to the remnant of the anterior horn of the native men...

TI  - Outcomes of postoperative septic arthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 1999
AB  - Arthroscopically guided reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament is a common orthopaedic procedure. While many associated complications have been described in the literature, postoperative septic arthritis has received little attention. Although rare after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, septic arthritis can have devastating consequences. From a group of 831 consecutive patients, we report 4 (0.48%) who sustained septic arthritis. All patients had similar symptoms and were treated by the same surgeon in the same manner. All underwent immediate arthroscopic lavage, open incision, drainage of associated wounds, debridement with graft retention, and treatment with intravenous and then oral antibiotics. The patients underwent an average of 2.75 procedures after the diagnosis to eradicate the infection and restore knee motion. All patients were evaluated at an average of 3 years after surgery. We found that previous knee surgery and meniscal repair were risk factors for the development of postoperative septic arthritis. The infection was successfully eradicated, the ligament graft was preserved, and knee stability and mobility were adequately restored in all patients. However, the clinical outcome of these patients appeared to be inferior to that of patients who had undergone uncomplicated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. This inferior outcome appeared to be secondary to damage to the articular cartilage from the infection.

          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A total of 100 patients (median age, 17 years; median preoperative Marx activity score, 16) with complete midsubstance ACL injuries were randomized to either the BEAR procedure (n = 65) or autograft ACLR (n = 35 [33 hamstring and 2 bone--patellar tendon-bone]) and underwent surgery within 45 days of injury. Objective, functional, and patient-reported outcomes, including the ACL--Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale, were assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Patients who underwent the BEAR procedure had significantly higher ACL-RSI scores at 6 months compared with those who underwent ACLR (71.1 vs 58.2; <i>P</i> = .008); scores were similar at 12 and 24 months. Baseline factors independently predictive of higher ACL-RSI scores at 6 months were having a BEAR procedure and participating in level 1 sports prior to injury, explaining 15% of the variability in the scores. Regression analysis of baseline and 6-month outcomes as predictors indicated that the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 6 months explained 45% of the 6-month ACL-RSI variance. Subsequent analysis with IKDC excluded from the model indicated that decreased pain, increased hamstring and quadriceps strength in the surgical limb, and decreased side-to-side difference in anteroposterior knee laxity were significant predictors of a higher ACL-RSI score at 6 months, explaining 34% of the variability in scores. Higher ACL-RSI score at 6 months was associated with earlier clearance to return to sports.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Patients who underwent the BEAR procedure had higher ACL-RSI scores at 6 months postoperatively. Better ACL-RSI scores at 6 months were related most strongly to higher IKDC scores at 6 months and were also associated with lower pain levels, better muscle recovery, and less knee laxity at 6 months.</AbstractText>

TI  - Knee Osteoarthritis After Single-Bundle Versus Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials
PY  - 2019
AB  - Purpose To systematically review high-quality studies in the literature to compare the postoperative radiographic incidence of knee osteoarthritis (OA) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with a single-bundle (SB) versus double-bundle (DB) graft. Methods A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase to locate randomized controlled trials that compared the postoperative progression of knee OA in SB versus DB ACLR patients. The search terms used were “anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,” “single-bundle,” “double-bundle,” “randomized,” and “osteoarthritis.” Patients were assessed based on radiographic evaluation (Kellgren-Lawrence [K-L] and objective International Knee Documentation Committee scales) and graft failure. Results A total of 7 studies (5 Level I and 2 Level II) met the inclusion criteria, including 375 SB and 477 DB ACLR patients with a mean follow-up period of 5.3 years. Graft failure occurred in 3.2% of patients overall (27 of 852), with no significant difference between groups (P = .10). No significant difference in overall K-L grade distribution was found between groups (P = .90). Overall, 15.1% of patients (58 of 383) were given a K-L grade of 2 or greater, including 14.4% in the SB group (31 of 215) and 16.1% in the DB group (27 of 168) (P = .65). Using other, unconventional grading schemes, 2 studies found DB ACLR patients to have significantly fewer signs of radiographic knee OA at follow-up compared with SB ACLR patients (P Conclusions Patients undergoing ACLR with either an SB or DB graft can be expected to experience a similar incidence of postoperative knee OA at midterm follow-up according to the K-L grading system. Level of Evidence Level II, systematic review of Level I and II studies.

TI  - Xenograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was associated with high graft processing infection
PY  - 2020
AB  - To evaluate clinical ad radiological outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with an immunochemically modified porcine patellar tendon xenograft controlled against human Achilles tendon allograft at 24-month minimum follow-up. 66 patients undergoing arthroscopic ACL reconstruction were randomized into 2 groups: 34 allografts and 32 xenografts treated to attenuate the host immune response. Follow-up was 24-month minimum. Anterior knee stability was measured as KT − 1000 side-to-side laxity difference (respect to the contralateral healthy knee). Functional performance was assessed by one-legged hop test. Objective manual pivot-shift test and subjective (IKDC, Tegner and SF-36) outcomes were collected. MRI and standard X-Ray were performed. 61 subjects (32 allograft, 29 xenograft) were evaluated at 12 and 24 months. Six of the subjects in xenograft group (20.6%) got an infection attributed to a water-based pathogen graft contamination in processing. Intention-to-treat analysis (using the last observation carried forward imputation method) revealed higher KT − 1000 laxity in xenograft group at 24-month follow-up (P = .042). Also pivot-shift was higher in xenograft group at 12-month (P = .015) and 24-month follow-up (P = .038). Per-protocol analysis (missing/contaminated subjects excluded) did not revealed clinical differences between groups. Tibial tunnel widening in the allograft group was low, whereas xenograft tunnel widening was within the expected range of 20–35% as reported in the literature. No immunological reactivity was associated to xenograft group. High infection rate (20.6%) was reported in xenograft group. Both groups of patients achieved comparable clinical outcomes if missing/contaminated subjects are excluded. Improved harvesting/processing treatments in future studies using xenografts for ACL reconstruction are needed to reduce infection rate, otherwise xenograft should not be used in ACL reconstruction.

TI  - The Cochrane Library - Surgical versus conservative interventions for treating anterior cruciate ligament injuries
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background
Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a common injury, mainly affecting young, physically active individuals. The injury is characterised by joint instability, leading to decreased activity, which can lead to poor knee-related quality of life. It is also associated with increased risk of secondary osteoarthritis of the knee. It is unclear whether stabilising the knee surgically via ACL reconstruction produces a better overall outcome than non-surgical (conservative) treatment.

Objectives
To assess the effects of surgical versus conservative interventions for treating ACL injuries.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (18 January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2016), MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (18 January 2016), EMBASE (1974 to 15 January 2016), trial registers (February 2016) and reference lists.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that compared the use of surgical and conservative interventions in participants with an ACL rupture. We included any trial that evaluated surgery for ACL reconstruction using any method of reconstruction, type of reconstruction technique, graft fixation or type of graft.

Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts for potentially eligible studies, for which we then obtained full-text reports. Two authors then independently confirmed eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence.

Main results
We identified one study in which 141 young, active adults with acute ACL injury were randomised to either ACL reconstruction followed by structured rehabilitation (results reported for 62 participants) or conservative treatment comprising structured rehabilitation alone (results reported for 59 participants). Built into the study design was a formal option for subsequent (delayed) ACL reconstruction in the conservative treatment group, if the participant requested surgery and met pre-specified criteria.

This study was deemed at low risk of selection and reporting biases, at high risk of performance and detection biases because of the lack of blinding and at unclear risk of attrition bias because of an imbalance in the post-randomisation exclusions. According to GRADE methodology, the overall quality of the evidence was low across different outcomes.

This study identified no difference in subjective knee score (measured using the average score on four of the five sub-scales of the KOOS score (range from 0 (extreme symptoms) to 100 (no symptoms)) between ACL reconstruction and conservative treatment at two years (difference in KOOS-4 change from baseline scores: MD -0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.78 to 6.38; N = 121 participants; low-quality evidence), or at five years (difference in KOOS-4 final scores: MD -2.0, 95% CI -8.27 to 4.27; N = 120 participants; low-quality evidence). The total number of participants incurring one or more complications in each group was not reported; serious events reported in the surgery group were predominantly surgery-related, while those in conservative treatment group were predominantly knee instability. There were also incomplete data for total participants with treatment failure, including subsequent surgery. In the surgical group at two years, there was low-quality evidence of far fewer ACL-related treatment failures, when defined as either graft rupture or subsequent ACL reconstruction. This result is dominated by the uptake by 39% (23/59) of the participants in the conservative treatment group of ACL reconstruction for knee instability at two years and by 51% (30/59) of the participants at five years. There was low-quality evidence of little difference between the two groups in participants who had undergone meniscal surgery at anytime up to five years. There was low-quality evidence of no clinically important between-group differences in SF-36 physical component scores at two years. There was low-quality evidence of a higher return to the same or greater level of sport activity at two years in the ACL reconstruction group, but the wide 95% CI also included the potential for a higher return in the conservative treatment group. Based on an illustrative return to sport activities of 382 per 1000 conservatively treated patients, this amounts to an extra 84 returns per 1000 ACL-reconstruction patients (95% CI 84 fewer to 348 more). There was very low-quality evidence of a higher incidence of radiographically-detected osteoarthritis in the surgery group (19/58 (35%) versus 10/55 (18%)).

Authors' conclusions
For adults with acute ACL injuries, we found low-quality evidence that there was no difference between surgical management (ACL reconstruction followed by structured rehabilitation) and conservative treatment (structured rehabilitation only) in patient-reported outcomes of knee function at two and five years after injury. However, these findings need to be viewed in the context that many participants with an ACL rupture remained symptomatic following rehabilitation and later opted for ACL reconstruction surgery. Further research, including the two identified ongoing trials, will help to address the limitations in the current evidence, which is from one small trial in a young, active, adult population.

TI  - Septic arthritis in postoperative anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2002
AB  - A review of postoperative infected anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions was done on 3500 consecutive arthroscopic procedures. The purpose was to assess incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome factors. Six postoperative in-traarticular infections were detected. Average followup was 3 years (range, 2-8 years). The rate of infection was 0.14%. Five men and one woman with a median age of 32.5 years (range, 20-51 years) comprised the study group. The average interval from the onset of symptoms to the initial arthroscopic intervention was 7.5 days (range, 2-20 days). Staphylococcus aureus was present in three knees, Staphylococcus epidermidis in two, and Streptococcus nonhemolytic in one. All patients had initial arthroscopic debridement and lavage followed by 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Two grafts were removed: one patient had delayed ligament reconstruction and the other had total knee arthroplasty. The remaining patients had full range of motion. In the group with the best result, two patients had Staphylococcus epidermidis and one had Staphylococcus aureus, which was treated 2 days after clinical symptoms began. The other two patients infected with Staphylococcus aureus had unsatisfactory results. Anterior cruciate ligament infection is rare, but diagnosable. When treated early with appropriate antibiotic therapy and arthroscopic debridement, four of six grafts were retained. If the infection does not respond rapidly to early therapy, then graft removal is an option.

In the adolescent cohort, older age was predictive of concomitant medial meniscectomy (<i>P</i> = .031). In the pediatric cohort, female sex was predictive of concomitant MM surgery and of undergoing lateral meniscectomy versus repair (<i>P</i>≤ .029). Female sex was associated with decreased odds of concomitant LM surgery in both cohorts (<i>P</i>≤ .018). Revision ACLR was predictive of concomitant MM surgery and of meniscectomy (medial and lateral) in the adolescent cohort (<i>P</i> &lt; .001).

TI  - Right and left knee laxity measurements: a prospective study of patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries and normal control subjects
PY  - 2004
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare knee laxity in a group of patients with a unilateral right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture and a group of patients with a unilateral left ACL rupture. Another goal was to analyze and compare the knee laxity of the right and left knees in a group of persons without any known knee problems. Type of study Prospective examination of the same patients preoperatively and 2 years after the reconstruction with examination of the healthy controls at 2 different occasions. Methods Group A was composed of 41 patients with a right-sided chronic ACL rupture, and group B was composed of 44 patients with a left-sided chronic ACL rupture. All patients underwent an arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft. Group C was composed of 35 persons without any known knee problems. One experienced physiotherapist performed all the KT-1000 measurements and the clinical examinations. Results Group A displayed an increased difference in side-to-side laxity between the injured and non-injured side compared with group B in terms of both anterior and total knee laxity. This difference was found to be statistically significant preoperatively ( P = .01, anterior; P = .001, total) and at follow-up evaluation 2 years after the index surgery ( P = .008, anterior; P = .006, total). In group C, a significant increase was seen in absolute anterior and total laxity in the right knee compared with the left knee when 2 repeated measurements were performed ( P P = .003, anterior; P P = .001, total). Conclusions The KT-1000 arthrometer revealed a significant increase in laxity measurements in right knees compared with left knees. This difference was found both preoperatively and postoperatively in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction. The same thing was found in a group of persons without any known knee problems. Level of evidence Level II.

PY  - 2008
AB  - Study Design Prospective cohort study. Objectives First, to classify a group of individuals with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-deficient knee as potential copers or potential noncopers, based on an established screening examination. Second, to prospectively follow a cohort of individuals with an ACL injury and characterize the nonoperatively treated subjects as true copers and true noncopers 1 year after injury, and evaluate the outcomes in operatively treated individuals 1 year after ACL reconstruction. Finally, to calculate the predictive value of the screening examination based on a 1-year follow-up of the group of subjects with ACL tears treated nonoperatively. Background A screening examination has been developed for early classification of individuals with ACL injuries. Potential copers have successfully been identified as rehabilitation candidates and have shown that they are able to continue preinjury activities without ACL reconstruction (true copers).

TI  - Large osteochondral fractures of the lateral femoral condyle in the adolescent: outcome of bioabsorbable pin fixation.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Background: Large osteochondral fractures of the lateral femoral condyle of the knee in adolescent patients can be diagnostically and therapeutically challenging. Historically, management has involved removal of the fragment, leaving a large area of bone devoid of articular cartilage on the weight-bearing surface of the lateral femoral condyle. This study assessed open reduction and internal fixation of the osteochondral fragments with use of multiple polyglycolic acid rods.

Methods: Eight patients, between twelve and fifteen years old, with a large (>4 cm2) osteochondral fracture of the lateral femoral condyle were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with use of multiple polyglycolic acid rods. Each patient was evaluated at more than five years (a mean of nine years) after the index procedure with a clinical assessment, during which the knee was scored according to the International Knee Documentation Committee and Cincinnati knee rating systems, plain radiographs were made, and magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired.

Results: The majority of patients scored well on both knee rating systems, with no poor results. Five of the eight patients had normal findings on knee radiographs, and three had radiographs that showed minor changes. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of all cpatients demonstrated intact articular cartilage in the lateral compartment with no area of full-thickness articular cartilage loss. No evidence of articular cartilage thinning was seen in two knees; a small area of <2 cm2 of cartilage thinning, in four; a moderate area of 2.7 cm2 of cartilage thinning, in one; and a large area of 11.2 cm2 of abnormal cartilage signal, in one knee.

Conclusions: Osteochondral fracture of the lateral femoral condyle is an injury to which adolescents with ligamentous laxity of the knee are prone. Our results show that internal fixation of these osteochondral fragments with bioabsorbable implants is possible and is a worthwhile option.

Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions to Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Comprehensive Study on Scoring and Grading Systems for Predicting the Severity of Knee Osteoarthritis.
PY  - 2024
AB  - Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a degenerative joint ailment characterized by cartilage loss, which can be seen using imaging modalities and converted into imaging features. The older population is the most affected by knee OA, which affects 16% of people worldwide who are 15 years of age and older. Due to cartilage tissue degradation, primary knee OA develops in older people. In contrast, joint overuse or trauma in younger people can cause secondary knee OA. Early identification of knee OA, according to research, may be a successful management tactic for the condition. Scoring scales and grading systems are important tools for the management of knee osteoarthritis as they allow clinicians to measure the progression of the disease's severity and provide suggestions on suitable treatment at identified stages. The comprehensive study reviews various subjective and objective knee evaluation scoring systems that effectively score and grade the KOA based on where defects or changes in articular cartilage occur. Recent studies reveal that AI-based approaches, such as that of DenseNet, integrating the concept of deep learning for scoring and grading the KOA, outperform various state-of-the-art methods in order to predict the KOA at an early stage.

TI  - Comparison of functional outcome after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction resulting in low, normal and increased laxity.
PY  - 2002
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse and compare the results after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using patellar tendon autografts in three groups of patients. The groups were determined by knee laxity as measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer at the follow-up two to five years after the reconstruction. Group A (n=15) had an anterior side-to-side laxity difference of <-3 mm (i.e. the reconstructed knee was less lax than the contralateral non-injured knee), Group B (n=376) had a difference of ≥-1, but ≤+2 mm and Group C (n=38) had a difference of ≥6 mm. All the patients had a normal contralateral knee. In Group A, 7/15 (47%) patients and, in Group B, 82/375 (22%) patients had an extension deficit of ≥5° (P=0.052). The corresponding values in terms of flexion deficit were 8/15 (53%) and 99/375 (26%) respectively (P=0.04) (one missing value in Group B). In Group C, 14/38 (37%) had an extension deficit (P=0.04; Group B vs Group C). Group C displayed worse results than Group B in terms of the Lysholm score and the one-leg-hop test (P=0.001 and P=0.011 respectively). The corresponding comparison between Group A and Group B revealed no significant differences. We conclude that a considerable number of patients showed persisting deficits in range of motion (ROM) after an ACL reconstruction. No major differences were found if they were analysed in subgroups with decreased, near normal or with increased knee laxity. The worst residual functional impairment, as measured with the Lysholm score and one-leg-hop test, was found in the group with increased knee laxity and most ROM deficits in the knees with decreased laxity.

TI  - Presentation, outcome, and cause of septic arthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a case control study.
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract Purpose: The objective of this study was to examine clinical presentation and medium-term outcome of patients with septic arthritis of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Type of Study: Matched case control study. Methods: From a consecutive case series of 575 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction from 1996 through 1999, we report on 10 patients (1.7%) with postoperative septic arthritis. These patients were compared with individually matched patients without infection, on average, 3 years after surgery. The examination included physical and radiographic evaluation, functional testing, KT-1000, Lysholm and Tegner scales, and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) form. Results: The predominant clinical presentation among patients with septic arthritis was modest classic signs of local infection. However, all had fever and elevated sedimentation rate or high C-reactive protein. Bacterial cultures showed coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species in 6, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, and Propionibacteriaceae species in 1 patient. The diagnosis was established with a delay of approximately 5 days. All patients underwent arthroscopic debridement and lavage (2 cases) or continuous irrigation (8 cases), as well as antibiotic treatment. One experienced graft rupture caused by the infection. At the end of the follow-up evaluation, the infected patients reported significantly lower activity levels than the control subjects (mean Tegner score, 5.3 v 7.2, P = .03). No statistically significant differences were noted in mean Lysholm, IKDC, or KOOS scores, or in KT-1000 difference. Two infected patients scored lower on the Tegner and Lysholm scales postoperatively than they did preoperatively. When examining the causes of infection, we found contamination by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus on supposedly sterile suture clamps on 3 graft preparation boards. Conclusions: In cases of suspected septic arthritis after ACL reconstruction, laboratory studies and aspiration followed by culture testing should be performed liberally to avoid the otherwise frequently delayed diagnosis. The inferior postoperative activity level noted in infected patients appeared not to be secondary to graft failure but may be related to arthrofibrosis, cartilage damage, or recurring postinfectious meniscal tears.

TI  - Arthroscopic pie-crusting release of the posteromedial complex of the knee for surgical treatment of medial meniscus injury
PY  - 2020
AB  - An arthroscopic narrow posteromedial gap of the knee may cause failure of a meniscus operation. The posteromedial complex (PMC) of the knee, including the posterior part of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and the posterior oblique ligament (POL), has a restrictive effect on the opening of the posteromedial gap of the knee in the half-extension position. Thus, we evaluated the radiological and clinical results of pie-crusting release of the PMC for arthroscopic meniscal surgery in tight knees. Sixty patients with posterior injury of the medial meniscus were reviewed. All patients accepted arthroscopic pie-crusting release of the PMC. Fourty patients accepted meniscoplasty, and 20 patients accepted meniscal suturing. To evaluate the arthroscopic opening of the medial gap in 20° half-extension under 11-kg valgus stress, the width of the medial space before and after release were measured. During follow-up, the medial stability was evaluated by radiographic measurements of the joint space width (JSW) in 20° half-extension. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted to evaluate healing of the MCL and meniscus. Knee functions were evaluated using VAS (visual analogy score), Lysholm, IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) and Tegner scoring systems. In all patients, meniscus operations were performed without iatrogenic cartilage injury. After PMC release, the arthroscopic width of the medial space was 5.7 ± 0.5 mm, larger than that before release (2.5 ± 0.5 mm, p   0.05). For sutured meniscus, MRI showed healing in 15 patients while five had two-grade abnormal signals. VAS, Lysholm, IKDC and Tegner scores were 1.80 ± 0.51, 80.08 ± 3.74, 82.17 ± 4.64 and 5.48 ± 0.59, respectively, showing significant differences compared with the preoperative scores (5.57 ± 0.69, 48.17 ± 4.22, 51.42 ± 4.02 and 3.20 ± 0.68, respectively, p< 0.01). Pie-crusting release of the PMC can increase the posteromedial space and improve the visual field of the knee under arthroscopy, while neither causing no residual valgus instability of the knee nor affecting the clinical outcome at the final follow-up.

TI  - Bioabsorbable Polyglyconate interference screw fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction : A prospective computed tomography-controlled study
PY  - 2000
AB  - Abstract Purpose: It was the purpose of the study to evaluate a new polyglyconate bioabsorbable interference screw for graft fixation in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Type of Study: Prospective randomized. Materials and Methods: Forty patients who underwent endoscopic ACL reconstruction were included in the study and randomized intraoperatively. Group A consisted of 20 patients (6 women, 14 men; mean age, 29.6 years) who had femoral bone block fixation with a bioabsorbable interference screw and tibial fixation with a titanium interference screw. Group B included 20 patients (5 women, 15 men; mean age 29.6 years) who had fixation of both femoral and tibial bone blocks with titanium interference screws. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to age, gender, height, weight, time from injury to surgery, activity level, and concomitant injuries. Results: Clinical results (using IKDC, Lysholm, Tegner scores) of the 2 groups as well as instrumented laxity measurements (KT-1000) did not show significant ( P >.05) differences at any stage of follow-up. No complications with respect to graft fixation could be found. Computed tomography scans, performed within the first postoperative week, at 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively revealed a uniform picture for all patients within the groups, showing completed screw degradation at 12 months in group A. Conclusion: Polyglyconate interference screw fixation for patellar tendon grafts has not been found to be associated with increased clinical complications or significant osteolysis. It provided equivalent fixation and clinical results compared with titanium screws. However, replacement of the screw with bone did not take place for up to 3 years postoperatively.

TI  - Changes in biochemical parameters after anterior cruciate ligament injury
PY  - 2005
AB  - We studied the biochemical characteristics of human knees with deficient anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) and analysed their relationship to the time after ligamentous injury. Thirty-two patients with isolated ACL-injured knees and six healthy volunteers were enrolled. Synovial fluid samples were centrifuged after aspiration during arthroscopic examination, and aliquots of supernatant were frozen and stored at −80°C. The samples were analysed for interleukin (IL)-1β, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 using commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In fluid from ACL-injured knees, the average concentrations of IL-6, MMP-3 and TIMP-1 were highly elevated in comparison with normal controls. There was a statistically significant correlation between the concentrations of MMP-3 and IL-6. The IL-6 and TIMP-1 concentrations were interrelated. The concentration of MMP-3 remained high, independent of the duration since the injury, whereas the TIMP-1 and IL-6 levels decreased. The results suggest that the timing of the treatment of an ACL-injured knee might be of importance.

TI  - A Hamstring-Based Anatomic Posterolateral Knee Reconstruction With Autografts Improves Both Radiographic Instability and Functional Outcomes.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Purpose To report the subjective outcomes and objective stability in a series of chronically grade III posterolateral injured knees treated with a hamstring-based anatomic posterolateral corner (PLC) reconstruction technique using autografts. Methods An outcome study of patients with a chronic complete tear of all ligamentous structures of the PLC (>5 mm of varus gapping at 30o, ≥10° of external tibial rotation during the dial test, ≥4 mm of increased lateral compartment opening during varus stress radiographs) was performed. The patients were evaluated subjectively with Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner scores and objectively with varus stress radiographs at 20° of knee flexion, IKDC objective scores, and recurvatum evaluation. Institutional review board approval: CEP/UNIFESP n: 1251/2016. Results Twenty-nine of 33 patients were available for follow up at an average of 31.9 ± 12.3 months (range, 24-59 months) postoperatively. Twenty-five patients underwent multiple-ligament reconstruction without prior osteotomy. No patient had an isolated PLC knee reconstruction. The average comparative preoperative and postoperative outcomes were, respectively: Lysholm: 49.7 ± 10.3, 81.2 ± 12.8, P Conclusions The presented anatomic PLC reconstruction, concomitant to other surgical procedures and ligament reconstructions, is a valid technique in a multiligamentous knee injury involving the PLC, improving subjective outcomes and objective stability in patients with a chronic PLC knee injury, similar to historical controls. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - MPFL reconstruction and tibial tuberosity transposition in patients with patellar instability: May it troubleshots also trochlear dysplasia?
PY  - 2021
AB  - PURPOSE This study aimed to highlight short- and medium-term outcomes of combined medial patello-femoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction and anterior tibial tuberosity (ATT) transposition surgery in patients with recurrent patellar instability and different degrees of trochlear dysplasia. METHODS Between January 2014 and May 2019, 25 patients with patellar instability underwent a surgical procedure combining the lowering/transposition of the ATT and the MPFL reconstruction. Each patient were preoperative assessed by Kujala score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner activity level scale. The assessment of instability predisposing factors was carried out with patellar height, tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance, trochlear dysplasia, sulcus angle, patellar tilt and MPFL injuries. Functional outcomes were evaluated with Kujala, IKDC and Tegner scores at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS The average age of the patients was 20 years (range 13-43 years). Pre- operative Caton-Deschamps index was pathological in 10 (40%). Sulcus angle was elevated in 13 patients (52%) and TT-TG distance was irregular in 17 patients (68%). Trochlear dysplasia was present in 13 patients (9 type A, 3 type B, 1 type C according to Dejour's Classification). No re-dislocation occurred during the follow-up. There was a significant increase in the Kujala, IKDC and Lysholm scores after 3, 6 and 12 months, and the results were compared for the different follow-up times and patient's trochlear dysplasia degree. CONCLUSION This prospective observational longitudinal study identified good clinical outcomes in patients who underwent MPFL reconstruction and ATT transposition for patellar instability. Finally, the different risk factors for patellar instability examined, particularly the presence of trochlear dysplasia, did not significantly influence the final functional results, which range from good to excellent without re-dislocation episodes.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Autograft with Remnant Preservation: Comparison of Outcomes According to the Amount of Remnant Tissue.
PY  - 2018
AB  - There has been controversy about whether remnant tissue of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has to be preserved in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of the study was to compare clinical outcomes between groups of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft divided according to amount of ACL remnant and investigate effect of remnant preservation on outcomes of ACL reconstruction. A total of 185 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with BPTB autograft were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into four groups according to proportion of length of remnant tissue of injured ACL covering part of reconstructed ACL to total length of reconstructed ACL: group A included 83 patients with no remnant, group B consisted of 38 patients with remnant of   2/3. Primary outcome was International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score. Secondary outcomes were stability, range of motion, patient-reported outcomes determined by Lysholm knee scoring scale and Tegner activity scale, IKDC objective grade, and single hop for distance. Return to activity and near-return to activity were investigated. A minimum follow-up duration was 24 months. There was no statistically significant difference between four groups regarding postoperative anterior translation (p = 0.731), Lysholm knee score (p = 0.599), IKDC objective grade (p > 0.999), hop test (p = 0.878), and near-return to activity (p = 0.193). However, patients of group D had significantly better outcomes in IKDC subjective score (group A = 85.0 ± 5.9, group B = 84.9 ± 8.1, group C = 87.4 ± 6.4, group D = 89.2 ± 8.1, p = 0.017), Tegner activity scale (group A = 5.0 ± 1.1, group B = 5.2 ± 1.0, group C = 5.7 ± 1.3, group D = 5.9 ± 1.0, p = 0.001), and return to activity (group A = 25.3%, group B = 31.6%, group C = 45.7%, group D = 55.2%, p = 0.014). ACL reconstruction using BPTB autograft with remnant preservation did not provide better anterior stability compared with conventional ACL reconstruction. However, preservation of remnant of > 2/3 led to more improved activity-related clinical outcomes than no remnant preservation. In cases with substantial remnant tissue of injured ACL remaining, reconstruction of ACL while preserving as much remnant tissue as possible is recommended. This is a Level III, retrospective comparative therapeutic study.

TI  - Normal Anterior Cruciate Ligament Laxity in the Malaysian Population
PY  - 2007
AB  - A study to determine average knee laxity in the Malaysian population and how it affects daily living was conducted at the University Malaya Medical Centre between January and April 2004. Fifty two male and 76 female subjects were recruited for this study, all of whom were healthy volunteers with no ambulatory problems. Side to side knee laxity testing was performed using a KT-1000 arthrometer. Significant differences in knee laxity were noted among different races and between sexes. For instance, overall, Chinese and female study participants had higher knee laxity: (left knee, 2.17 mm (SD=1.30) and right knee was 2.88 mm (SD= 1.51)). On average, the difference between knees was 0.70 ± 1.26 mm (less than 1 mm) which is a smaller variation than reported in previous studies which suggested 3 mm. Despite finding knee laxity ranging from 0 to 8mm, no correlations were found between Lysholm, IKDC and Tegner knee outcome scores and the degree of knee laxity. No other predictors such as height, weight and age correlated with levels of knee laxity. We therefore conclude that knee laxity is a common occurrence in the normal population and is therefore not suitable as a sole predictor of knee function and should not be used as the only criteria for surgical intervention.

TI  - Hip joint biomechanics in those with and without post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament injury
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Background Anterior cruciate ligament injury results in altered kinematics and kinetics in the knee and hip joints that persist despite surgical reconstruction and rehabilitation. Abnormal movement patterns and a history of osteoarthritis are risk factors for articular cartilage degeneration in additional joints. The purpose of this study was to determine if hip joint biomechanics early after anterior cruciate ligament injury and reconstruction differ between patients with and without post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis 5 years after reconstruction. The study's rationale was that individuals who develop knee osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament injury may also demonstrate large alterations in hip joint biomechanics. Methods Nineteen athletes with anterior cruciate ligament injury completed standard gait analysis before (baseline) and after (post-training) extended pre-operative rehabilitation and at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after reconstruction. Weightbearing knee radiographs were completed 5 years after reconstruction to identify medial compartment osteoarthritis. Findings Five of 19 patients had knee osteoarthritis at 5 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Patients with knee osteoarthritis at 5 years walked with smaller sagittal plane hip angles ( P : 0.043) and lower sagittal ( P : 0.021) and frontal plane ( P : 0.042) external hip moments in the injured limb before and after reconstruction compared to those without knee osteoarthritis. Interpretation The current findings suggest hip joint biomechanics may be altered in patients who develop post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis. Further study is needed to confirm whether the risk of non-traumatic hip pathology is increased after anterior cruciate ligament injury and if hip joint biomechanics influence its development.

TI  - Rehabilitation and recovery after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: patients' experiences.
PY  - 2007
AB  - The aim was to explore patients’ experiences of the rehabilitation process after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Ten participants were enrolled in the study. Semi-structured interviews were performed, focusing on challenges during the post-operative rehabilitation to 1 year after ACL reconstruction. The participants perceived no real choice between operative and non-operative treatment. Only surgery symbolized a full return to the pre-injury level of sports, and surgery was understood as the only way to become a completely restored ‘‘functional human being.’’ A major source of frustration was that the meaning of and progress during the rehabilitation did not match their expectations. Three different responses to the challenge of a prolonged rehabilitation were expressed: ‘‘going for it,’’ ‘‘being ambivalent,’’ and ‘‘giving in.’’ Fear of re-injury was common; however, some participants decided not to return to their pre-injury level of sports due to reasons other than physical limitations or fear of re-injury. From a patient perspective, it seems important that the choice of operative or non-operative treatment should be discussed in terms of the meaning and extent of the post-operative rehabilitation and the expected outcomes. There also seems to be a need for more guidance in realistic goal setting and coaching throughout the rehabilitation process.

TI  - Does severity or specific joint laxity influence clinical outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2009
AB  - It generally is believed generalized joint laxity is one of the risk factors for failure of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. However, no consensus exists regarding whether adverse effects on ACL reconstruction are attributable to joint-specific laxity or are related to the severity of generalized joint laxity. We therefore asked whether knee stability and functional outcomes would be related to joint-specific laxity and would differ according to the severity of generalized joint laxity. The Beighton and Horan criteria were used to assess joint laxity in 272 subjects. All elements are added to give an overall joint laxity score ranging from 0 to 5. Knee translation did not increase in proportion to the severity of the generalized joint laxity. Patients with scores less than 4 showed similar knee stability. When all variables, including the severity of generalized joint laxity, were considered, only hyperextension of the knee independently predicted knee stability and function. In patients with knee hyperextension, a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft provided superior stability and function compared with a hamstring tendon autograft. Our data suggest knee hyperextension predicts postoperative stability and function regardless whether patients have severe generalized joint laxity.

TI  - Laxity and Functional Outcome After Arthroscopic Reduction and Internal Fixation of Displaced Tibial Spine Fractures in Children
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate laxity and functional outcome of displaced tibial spine fractures in skeletally immature patients treated with arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation. Type of Study: Retrospective case series. Methods: Six patients (mean age, 12.0 years old) underwent subjective, objective, and instrumented knee laxity assessment at minimum 2 years (mean, 3.2 years) of follow-up time after arthroscopic reduction and 3.5-mm cannulated screw fixation of (Meyers and McKeever type III) tibial spine fractures. Results: Physical examination showed persistent laxity, with an abnormal Lachman examination in 5 of 6 patients and an abnormal pivot-shift examination in 2 of 6 patients. Instrumented knee laxity (KT-1000) showed greater than 3-mm manual-maximum side-to-side difference in 4 of 6 patients. Functional assessment revealed excellent function, with a mean Lysholm score of 99.5 (range, 98–100), mean Marshall score of 49.0 (range, 47–50), and mean Tegner score of 8.7 (range, 7–9). Conclusions: Arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation of type III tibial spine fractures in skeletally immature patients results in persistent laxity but excellent functional outcome.

TI  - Peel-Off Injury at the Tibial Attachment of the Posterior Cruciate Ligament in Children:
PY  - 2010
AB  - Background: Careful review of the literature seldom reveals peel-off–type injuries at the tibial attachment of the posterior cruciate ligament in children.Purpose: The purpose of this research is to describe the diagnosis and treatment of peel-off injuries at the tibial ligament–osseous junction of the posterior cruciate ligament in children.Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Methods: Between February 2001 and May 2007, 6 patients with diagnosed peel-off injuries at the tibial attachment of the posterior cruciate ligament were surgically treated. All patients were boys from 12 to 13 years of age (mean, 12.3 years). Plain radiographs were normal, but magnetic resonance imaging and arthroscopic findings revealed complete avulsion of the posterior cruciate ligament at the tibial attachment without an osseous fragment. The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical presentations, diagnostic tests, surgical procedures, and the results of the treatment. The mean follow-up was 37.3 months (range,...

TI  - Development of a Patient-Reported Measure of Function of the Knee*
PY  - 1998
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the Activities of Daily Living Scale of the Knee Outcome Survey, a patient-reported measure of functional limitations imposed by pathological disorders and impairments of the knee during activities of daily living. The study comprised 397 patients; 213 were male, 156 were female, and the gender was not recorded for the remaining twenty-eight. The mean age of the patients was 33.3 years (range, twelve to seventy-six years). The patients were referred to physical therapy because of a wide variety of disorders of the knee, including ligamentous and meniscal injuries, patellofemoral pain, and osteoarthrosis. The Activities of Daily Living Scale was administered four times during an eight-week period: at the time of the initial evaluation and after one, four, and eight weeks of therapy. Concurrent measures of function included the Lysholm Knee Scale and several global measures of function. The subjects also provided an assessment of the change in function, with responses ranging from greatly worse to greatly better, at one, four, and eight weeks. The Activities of Daily Living Scale was administered to an additional sample of fifty-two patients (thirty-two male and twenty female patients with a mean age of 31.6 years [range, fourteen to sixty-six years]) before and after treatment within a single day to establish test-retest reliability. Factor analysis revealed two dominant factors: one that reflected a combination of symptoms and functional limitations and the other, only symptoms. The internal consistency of the Activities of Daily Living Scale was substantially higher than that of the Lysholm Knee Scale (coefficient alpha, 0.92 to 0.93 compared with 0.60 to 0.73), resulting in a smaller standard error of measurement for the former scale. Validity was demonstrated by moderately strong correlations with concurrent measures of function, including the Lysholm Knee Scale (r = 0.78 to 0.86) and the global assessment of function as measured on a scale ranging from 0 to 100 points (r = 0.66 to 0.75). Analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed significant improvements in the score on the Activities of Daily Living Scale during the eight weeks of physical therapy (F2,236 = 108.13; p < 0.0001); post hoc testing indicated that the change in the score at eight weeks was significantly greater than the change at four weeks and that the change at four weeks was significantly greater than that at one week (p < 0.0001 for both). As had been hypothesized, the patients in whom the knee had somewhat improved had a significantly smaller change in the score, both at four weeks (F1,189 = 33.50; p < 0.001) and at eight weeks (F1,156 = 22.48; p < 0.001), compared with those in whom the knee had greatly improved. The test-retest reliability coefficient (intraclass correlation coefficient[2,1]) was 0.97. These results suggest that the Activities of Daily Living Scale is a reliable, valid, and responsive instrument for the assessment of functional limitations that result from a wide variety of pathological disorders and impairments of the knee.

TI  - Effect of Fatigue on Electromyographic Activity Patterns of the Knee Joint Muscles in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstructed and Deficient Patients during Landing Task
PY  - 2018
AB  - Lower extremity fatigue causes a number of neuromuscular alterations that may increase the risk of knee (re)injury. It has therefore been suggested that fatigue-resistance training be incorporated into injury prevention and rehabilitation programs. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of fatigue on knee-muscle activity patterns after anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL). Twelve healthy, 12 ACL reconstructed (ACLR) and 12 ACL deficient (ACLD) recreationally active male volunteers participated in this case-control study. Fatigue was induced via repetitive sets of double-leg squats and drop landings. Muscle activity was assessed via surface electromyography during a single-leg drop landing task pre- and post-fatigue. After fatigue, medial hamstring, lateral hamstring and vastus lateralis muscles turned on significantly earlier in ACLR compared to the control group. Significantly greater vastus medialis muscle activity was observed in ACLD compared to ACLR and control participants post-fatigue. Finally, fatigue decreased lateral gastrocnemius muscle activity in ACLD and control participants. It seems ACLR patients rely on earlier muscle pre-activation to establish knee joint stability upon landing after fatigue. This feed-forward strategy should be emphasized during post-operative rehabilitation in ACLR patients. Furthermore, according to our results, quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles play an important role in establishing knee joint stability post impact in ACLD patients.

TI  - Kinesiophobia after anterior cruciate ligament rupture and reconstruction: noncopers versus potential copers.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Study Design Secondary-analysis, longitudinal cohort study. Objectives To compare kinesiophobia levels in noncopers and potential copers at time points spanning pre- and post-anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and to examine the association between changes in kinesiophobia levels and clinical measures. Background After ACL injury, a screening examination may be used to classify patients as potential copers or noncopers based on dynamic knee stability. Quadriceps strength, single-leg hop performance, and self-reported knee function are worse in noncopers. High kinesiophobia levels after ACL reconstruction are associated with poorer self-reported knee function and lower return-to-sport rates. Kinesiophobia levels have not been examined before ACL reconstruction, across the transition from presurgery to postsurgery, or based on potential coper and noncoper classification. Methods Quadriceps strength indexes, single-leg hop score indexes, self-reported knee function (Knee Outcome Survey activitie...

TI  - Does autograft choice determine intermediate-term outcome of ACL reconstruction?
PY  - 2010
AB  - Many clinical studies and systematic reviews have compared the short-term (2 years) outcomes of ACL reconstruction with hamstring and patellar tendon autograft. Few differences have been observed, with the exception of increased kneeling pain with patellar tendon grafts. The goal of this systematic review is to determine whether there are differences in clinical, patient-reported, or radiographic outcomes based on graft choice at a minimum of 5 years after ACL reconstruction. A systematic review was performed to identify all prospective outcome studies comparing patellar tendon and hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction with minimum follow-up of at least 5 years. Seven studies were identified and meta-analysis of select data determined to be sufficiently homogenous was performed (failure and laxity). Five randomized controlled trials and two prospective cohorts comparing hamstring and patellar tendon autografts were identified. Clinical assessment [failure rate, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) class, Lachman, pivot shift, and KT 1000 testing] showed no difference between grafts. Patient-reported outcomes (Lysholm, Cincinnati, and IKDC) showed no difference. Both anterior knee pain (3/3 studies) and kneeling pain (4/4 studies) were more frequent in the patellar tendon group. However, the patient-reported outcomes in these studies were not different. Radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis was inconsistent between autograft choices. This level II systematic review demonstrates no difference in major clinical results between graft types with the exception of increased anterior knee and kneeling pain. There exists a potential for increased incidence of osteoarthritis in the patellar tendon group but increased sample size is required. These longer-term outcomes are similar to results of prior systematic reviews with two-year follow-up.

TI  - Gait Asymmetries Persist 1 Year After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background:After anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), motivation to return to previous levels of activity is high. Very few studies have used return-to-activity criteria to determine when to permit athletic play. Return-to-activity measures objectively evaluate functional limb symmetry; however, previous biomechanical studies have found gait deviations in these individuals that persist up to 2 years after surgery.Purpose:To evaluate gait biomechanics in a specific cohort of ACL patients 1 year after surgery and retrospectively compare individuals who pass return-to-activity criteria 6 months after surgery with those who fail.Study Design:Prospective analysis.Methods:A total of 40 athletes who participated regularly (>50 h/y) in cutting, jumping, and pivoting activities and who sustained an isolated, unilateral ACL rupture were included in this study. All participants underwent reconstruction by the same surgeon and received individualized postoperative rehabilitation. Performance-based and se...

TI  - Predictors of Graft Failure in Young Active Patients Undergoing Hamstring Autograft Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With or Without a Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis: The Stability Experience.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) has higher failure rates in young active patients returning to sports as compared with older, less active individuals. Augmentation of ACLR with an anterolateral procedure has been shown to reduce failure rates; however, indications for this procedure have yet to be clearly defined.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of ACL graft failure in high-risk patients and determine key indications for when hamstring ACLR should be augmented by a lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET). We hypothesized that different preoperative characteristics and surgical variables may be associated with graft failure characterized by asymmetric pivot shift and graft rupture.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="METHODS">Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Data were obtained from the Stability 1 Study, a multicenter randomized controlled trial of young active patients undergoing autologous hamstring ACLR with or without a LET. We performed 2 multivariable logistic regression analyses, with asymmetric pivot shift and graft rupture as the dependent variables. The following were included as predictors: LET, age, sex, graft diameter, tear chronicity, preoperative high-grade knee laxity, preoperative hyperextension on the contralateral side, medial meniscal repair/excision, lateral meniscal repair/excision, posterior tibial slope angle, and return-to-sports exposure time and level.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Of the 618 patients in the Stability 1 Study, 568 with a mean age of 18.8 years (292 female; 51.4%) were included in this analysis. Asymmetric pivot shift occurred in 152 (26.8%) and graft rupture in 43 (7.6%). The addition of a LET (odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37-0.83) and increased graft diameter (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44-0.87) were significantly associated with lower odds of asymmetric pivot shift. The addition of a LET (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18-0.91) and older age (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.96) significantly reduced the odds of graft rupture, while greater tibial slope (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.32), preoperative high-grade knee laxity (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.45-7.41), and greater exposure time to sport (ie, earlier return to sport) (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.08-1.29) were significantly associated with greater odds of rupture.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The addition of a LET and larger graft diameter were significantly associated with reduced odds of asymmetric pivot shift. Adding a LET was protective of graft rupture, while younger age, greater posterior tibial slope, high-grade knee laxity, and earlier return to sport were associated with increased odds of graft rupture. Orthopaedic surgeons should consider supplementing hamstring autograft ACLR with a LET in young active patients with morphological characteristics that make them at high risk of reinjury.</AbstractText>

TI  - Extended Preoperative Rehabilitation: Does It Influence Return to Sport After Surgery?
PY  - 2019
AB  - Preoperative rehabilitation refers to a period of extended rehabilitation prior to surgery that goes beyond basic impairment resolution to improve outcomes after surgery. Successful post-surgical outcomes are influenced by the functional status of the knee joint prior to surgery. Clinicians and researchers from the Delaware-Oslo cohort implement a progressive, extended preoperative rehabilitation program that focuses on neuromuscular training, progressive strengthening, and plyometric and agility training. The program consists of a series of 10 rehabilitation sessions, at least two times per week, with a goal of achieving specific preoperative milestones prior to anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). After extended preoperative rehabilitation and ACLR, athletes should progress through criterion-based postoperative rehabilitation milestones and meet stringent, performance-based measures (at least 90% quadriceps index, 90% limb symmetry index (LSI) on four hop tests, and 90% on Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living Scale and Global Rating of Perceived Function) prior to receiving return to sport (RTS) clearance. We recommend delaying return to level I sports, those involving jumping, cutting, or pivoting, until at least 9 months after ACLR to reduce the risk of reinjury. Our research from the Delaware-Oslo cohort indicates that extended preoperative rehabilitation plus criterion-based postoperative rehabilitation, compared to criterion-based postoperative rehabilitation alone, results in higher patient-reported outcomes and RTS rates 2 years after ACLR. Extended preoperative rehabilitation, described in detail in this chapter, may be a critical component to improve functional and RTS outcomes as well as reduce secondary injury rates after ACLR.

PY  - 1999
AB  - To evaluate the risks of skiing after anterior cruciate ligament injury with or without reconstruction, we performed a 3-year study of 5646 skiers employed by a large ski resort. All skiers underwent knee ligament examinations before entering the study. The participants were divided into three groups based on whether they had never had an anterior cruciate ligament injury (N 4748), were unilaterally deficient of the ligament (N 138), or had undergone a unilateral reconstruction of the ligament at least 1 year before (N 274). The rates of knee injuries requiring evaluation by a physician or time off work were calculated. The results of the reconstructed knees were further evaluated to determine whether ligament repair with semitendinosus/gracilis or patellar tendon autograft had a higher injury rate. Compared with knees with intact anterior cruciate ligaments, ligament-deficient knees had a 6.2-times higher rate of injuries, and knees in which the ligament had been reconstructed had a 3.1-times higher rate...

TI  - Relationship between Widening and Position of the Tunnels and Clinical Results of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction to Knee Osteoarthritis: 30 Patients at a Minimum Follow-Up of 10 Years.
PY  - 2016
AB  - To evaluate the relationship between tunnel position and widening and long-term clinical results in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, a retrospective cohort of 30 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with double semitendinous plus double gracilis (SAC technique) with longer than 10-year follow-up was selected. CT scans in the first 3 months and at final follow-up was evaluated. Position, angle, and widening of tunnels including Nebelung criteria were recorded in all CT scans. Physical, KT-1000, and clinical evaluation were performed at final follow-up. Outcomes and knee arthritis severity were evaluated at final follow-up. Mean follow-up was 11.2 ± 1.2. At final follow-up, 85 and 57% of tibial and femoral tunnels, respectively, developed some degree of enlargement. Frontal tibial angle (mean) was 72°, sagittal tibial angle 63°, frontal femoral angle 47°, sagittal femoral angle 20°, and tunnels divergence angle 36°. Preoperatively, KT-1000 30L and Lachman test scores were 5.52 and 5.79 respectively. In the last follow-up, 30L and manual Lachman test scores were 0.97 and 1.13, respectively (p

TI  - The association between radiographic knee osteoarthritis and knee symptoms, function and quality of life 10–15 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2010
AB  - Background There are conflicting results in the literature regarding the association between radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA) and symptoms and function in subjects with previous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Aim To investigate the associations between radiographic tibiofemoral knee OA and knee pain, symptoms, function and knee-related quality of life (QOL) 10–15 years after ACL reconstruction. Study design Cross-sectional study. Material and methods 258 subjects were consecutively included at the time of ACL reconstruction and followed up prospectively. The authors included the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score to evaluate knee pain, other symptoms (symptoms), activities of daily living and sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and QOL. The subjects underwent standing radiographs 10–15 years after the ACL reconstruction. The radiographs were graded with the Kellgren and Lawrence (K&L) classification (grade 0–4). Results 210 subjects (81%) consented to participate in the 10–15-year follow-up. Radiographic knee OA (K&L ≥grade 2) was detected in 71%, and 24% showed moderate or severe radiographic knee OA (K&L grades 3 and 4). No significant associations were detected between radiographic knee OA (K&L grade ≥2) and pain, function or QOL, respectively, but subjects with radiographic knee OA showed significantly increased symptoms. Severe radiographic knee OA (K&L grade 4) was significantly associated with more pain, symptoms, impaired Sport/Rec and reduced QOL. Conclusion Subjects with radiographic knee OA showed significantly more symptoms than those without OA, and subjects with severe radiographic knee OA had significantly more pain, impaired function and reduced quality of life than those without radiographic knee OA 10–15 years after ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Dynamic intraligamentary stabilisation: initial experience with treatment of acute ACL ruptures
PY  - 2016
AB  - Aims The purpose of this study was to report the experience of dynamic
intraligamentary stabilisation (DIS) using the Ligamys device for
the treatment of acute ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament
(ACL). Patients and Methods Between March 2011 and April 2012, 50 patients (34 men and 16
women) with an acute rupture of the ACL underwent primary repair
using this device. The mean age of the patients was 30 years (18
to 50). Patients were evaluated for laxity, stability, range of
movement (ROM), Tegner, Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee
(IKDC) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores over a follow-up period
of two years. Results At final follow-up, anteroposterior translation differed from
the normal knee by a mean of 0.96 mm (-2 mm to 6 mm). Median (interquartile
range) IKDC, Tegner, Lysholm and VAS scores were 98 (95 to 100),
6 (5 to 7), 100 (98 to 100) and 10 (9 to 10), respectively. Pre-injury
Tegner activity levels were reached one year post-operatively. A
total of nine patients (18%) required a secondary intervention;
five developed instability, of whom four underwent secondary hamstring
reconstructive surgery, and five required arthroscopic treatment
for intra-articular impingement due to scar tissue which caused
a fixed flexion deformity. In addition, 30 patients (60%) required
removal of the tibial screw. Conclusion While there was a high rate of secondary interventions, 45 patients
(90%) retained their repaired ACL two years post-operatively, with
good clinical scores and stability of the knee. Take home message: Dynamic intraligamentary stabilisation presents
a promising treatment option for acute ACL ruptures, eliminating
the need for ACL reconstruction. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2016;98-B:793–8.

TI  - Predictors of Early Return to Sport After Surgical Repair of Proximal Hamstring Complex Injuries in Professional Athletes: A Prospective Study.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Proximal hamstring complex injury (PHCI) is a common injury among professional athletes, particularly those participating in pivot contact sports. Previous studies have suggested that surgery can be effective in restoring function and allowing athletes to return to sport (RTS), but the factors influencing successful RTS have been less clear.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To assess RTS capabilities after surgical treatment of PHCI in professional athletes and to identify favorable predictors of RTS.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This study (2002-2022) was conducted on professional athletes who underwent surgical treatment for PHCI at a sports surgery center. The primary outcome of the study was the RTS capability, evaluated based on the rate of athletes' return to their preinjury level of competition, time delay to RTS, and quality of RTS as measured using their level of performance and progression of scores on activity scales such as the Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), scale. "Maintained performance" was defined as athletes returning to the same preinjury activity level (per the TAS and UCLA scale) and perceiving themselves to have maintained their performance. Secondary outcomes covered the potential RTS predictors and complication rate. The study distinguished 2 types of PHCI: proximal hamstring tendon avulsion injury (proximal rupture with empty footprint, or having a "positive dropped ice cream sign") and complete proximal hamstring free tendon rupture (PHTR; proximal rupture without empty footprint, or having a "negative dropped ice cream sign").</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The study examined 64 professional athletes (mean age, 27.3 years; 82.8% male) undergoing surgery for PHCI. The RTS rate was 98.4%, with 78.1% of the athletes returning to their preinjury level of competition at 6.2 months (SD, 2.5 months). Twelve (19%) patients had returned to sport at an inferior level of competition, and 2 (3.1%) were unable to continue in their preinjury sport. Subgroup analysis revealed variation in RTS based on sport type, with the highest rate of return to preinjury performance found in athletes in handball and sports with splits (fencing, squash, and escalade; 100%) and soccer (95.2%). In the univariate analysis, male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 4.05; 95% CI, 1.45-11.3; <i>P</i> = .008), higher preinjury TAS score (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06-1.52; <i>P</i> = .011), injury involving the semimembranosus (HR, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.31-10.2; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) or conjoint tendon (HR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.55-6.25; <i>P</i> = .001), and PHTR (HR, 7.77; 95% CI, 3.54-17.0; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) were significantly associated with a better postoperative level of competition. Multivariate analysis identified 3 favorable predictors of RTS with HRs of 2.91 (95% CI, 1.01-8.35; <i>P</i> = .047) for male sex, 3.86 (95% CI, 1.78-8.37; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) for isolated semimembranosus injury, and 5.18 (95% CI, 2.24-12.0; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) for PHTR. The complication rate was 4.7%.</AbstractText>

TI  - Actifit® scaffold implantation: Influence of preoperative meniscal extrusion on morphological and clinical outcomes.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract Background Meniscal substitutes have been suggested for the treatment of knee pain after partial meniscectomy. However, despite the partial nature of the initial meniscectomy, secondary extrusion of the substitute is common. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate morphological outcomes of meniscal substitute implantation and their potential associations with preoperative meniscal extrusion. Hypothesis Preoperative absolute meniscal extrusion in the coronal plane predicts poorer morphological and clinical outcomes. Material and methods Consecutive patients who received an Actifit ® meniscal substitute between 2008 and 2011 were included prospectively. After 1 year and 2 years, the IKDC score and KOOS were determined and magnetic resonance imaging performed. The morphological evaluation consisted in measuring meniscal extrusion and cartilage coverage by the substitute in the coronal and sagittal planes. Results Twenty patients were included. Among them, 3 required subsequent removal of the substitute. The mean subjective IKDC score increased from 48.1 preoperatively to 56.4 after 2 years. Over the same period, the function/sports/recreational activities component of the KOOS improved significantly (42.9 vs. 55.0, P  = 0.04). Positive correlations between preoperative and 1-year values were demonstrated for both cartilage coverage in the coronal and the sagittal planes ( P  = 0.03 and P  = 0.04, respectively) and coronal absolute meniscal extrusion ( P  = 0.05). No significant differences were found between preoperative and 2-year values of cartilage coverage in the coronal and sagittal planes ( P  = 0.38). There was a negative correlation linking preoperative meniscal extrusion in the coronal plane to 1-year cartilage coverage in the coronal and sagittal planes ( P  = 0.01 and P  = 0.04, respectively). Preoperative absolute meniscal extrusion in the coronal plane correlated negatively with the subjective IKDC score after 1 year ( P  = 0.02). Discussion Preoperative meniscal extrusion in the coronal plane strongly predicts clinical and morphological outcomes. Marked preoperative meniscal extrusion, even in a patient with symptoms after partial meniscectomy, should prompt an appraisal of whether allograft replacement may be more appropriate than a meniscal substitute. Level of evidence IV, prospective study.

PY  - 2012
AB  - Background:The authors developed a novel technique to improve tendon-bone healing by hybridizing calcium phosphate (CaP) with a tendon graft using an alternating soaking process.Hypothesis:Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the CaP-hybridized tendon graft would have a better clinical outcome and reduce the percentage of bone tunnel enlargement compared with a conventional method because of the enhanced anchoring between the tendon graft and the bone.Study Design:Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.Methods:Patients (N = 64) with unilateral ACL rupture underwent arthroscopically assisted single-bundle ACL reconstruction using a 4-strand semitendinosus tendon or 4-strand semitendinosus and gracilis tendons with EndoButton femoral fixation and screw washer tibial fixation. These patients were equally randomized to undergo the CaP (n = 32) or conventional (n = 32) method using a transtibial tunnel approach according to the closed envelope method. In the CaP group, the tendon gr...

TI  - Ultrasonographic Evaluation of Anterolateral Ligament Injuries: Correlation With Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Pivot-Shift Testing
PY  - 2017
AB  - Purpose (1) To compare the diagnostic ability of ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect anterolateral ligament (ALL) injuries in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)–deficient patients, and (2) to evaluate the correlation between ALL injury status (as determined by US and MRI) and the knee's rotational stability. Methods Thirty patients with an isolated ACL injury were included prospectively over a 3-month period. The condition of the ALL was evaluated by 2 experienced radiologists using both US and MRI. Rotational stability was evaluated by 2 surgeons with the pivot-shift test with patients under general anesthesia. It was classified as either negative (grades 0 and I) or positive (grades II and III). The radiologists were blinded to the knee's rotational stability, and the surgeons were blinded to the ALL's status based on the US images. The correlation between the ALL's injury status (US and MRI) and the pivot shift was determined with the Pearson χ 2 test. To evaluate the reproducibility of the results, the agreement between observers was determined with the Cohen κ coefficient. Results On US, the ALL was identified and visible over its entire length in 100% of patients (30 of 30, κ = 1). The ALL was injured in 63% of patients (19 of 30, κ = 0.93). On MRI, the ALL was identified in 96% of patients (29 of 30, κ = 0.91). The ALL appeared injured in 53% of cases (16 of 30, κ = 0.93). An ALL that appeared injured on US was more often associated with a positive pivot shift than was an uninjured ALL (75% vs 39%, χ 2  = 13.7, P Conclusions US is a reproducible examination for the diagnosis of ALL injury. An ALL injury is most often associated with a high pivot-shift grade. Level of Evidence Level II, prospective comparative study.

TI  - Hamstring graft incorporation according to the length of the graft inside tunnels
PY  - 2017
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with a quadrupled semitendinosus (ST4) graft is an evolution of the standard technique with 2 hamstring tendons (semitendinosus + gracilis [STG]). However, there is no published comparison of how well these 2 types of hamstring grafts are incorporated into the bone tunnels. Because the ST4 graft is shorter, there is less graft material inside the tunnels. PURPOSE: To use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare graft incorporation in the tibial bone tunnels 1 year after ACL reconstruction with either an STG graft or ST4 graft. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: Sixty-two patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were enrolled prospectively: 31 with an ST4 graft and 31 with an STG graft. The same surgical technique, fixation method, and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. Graft incorporation and ligamentization were evaluated with MRI after 1 year of follow-up. The following parameters were evaluated: signal-to-noise quotient (SNQ), tibial tunnel enlargement, signal intensity at the bone-graft interface, and graft signal according to the Howell scale. The number of participants needed to show that the mean SNQ did not differ between the 2 techniques was 31 in each group (with a 1-sided alpha of 2.5% and a 1-sided beta of 10.0%). The Student t test was used to compare the distribution of continuous secondary endpoints. RESULTS: The mean SNQ was 5.2 ± 4.5 for the STG group and 5.9 ± 3.7 for the ST4 group ( P = .5100). The mean tibial tunnel widening was 93.7% ± 51.7% for the STG group versus 80.0% ± 42.9% for the ST4 group ( P = .2605). The groups did not differ in signal intensity at the bone-graft interface ( P = .7502) or in graft signal according to the Howell scale ( P = .4544). CONCLUSION: At the 1-year postoperative follow-up, incorporation and ligamentization of the STG and ST4 grafts were the same based on MRI analysis. The results were at least as good with the ST4 technique as with the standard STG technique in terms of incorporation and ligamentization.

TI  - Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: The Italian Experience
PY  - 2008
AB  - In our original technique, semitendinosus/gracilis tendons are harvested without detaching their tibial insertion, and sutures are tightened at their free proximal extremities. The tibial tunnel is performed in the medial-posterior portion of the native anterior cruciate ligament tibial insertion. For the femoral tunnel, the knee is flexed at 130° and the guide pin is advanced in the 9:30 clockwise position until it passes the lateral femoral condyle cortex. The exit point in the lateral aspect of the femur has to be immediately above the end of the lateral femoral condyle. After the lateral incision, the tendons are passed over the top. The correct placement is found by palpating the posterior tubercle of the lateral femoral condyle. The stitches on the free proximal end of the tendons are tied onto the passing suture that is pulled through the joint to the over the top position. A suture loop is introduced into the joint through the anteromedial portal using a suture passer and then pulled into the femoral tunnel under the arthroscopic view. The stitches on the free end of the tendons are looped again onto the passing suture, which is pulled through the femoral tunnel, the knee joint, and the tibial tunnel to retrieve back the graft from the tibial incision. The combined gracilis and semitendinosus graft are then tensioned and fixed with a transosseous suture or a staple. This technique reproduces the kinematic effect of posterolateral and anteromedial anterior cruciate ligament bundles with a 4-stranded graft, although achieving a better anatomic and functional result.

PY  - 2010
AB  - BackgroundLigament restraints to terminal knee extension are poorly understood.Hypotheses(1) As with other motions of the knee, genu recurvatum is limited primarily by a named, identifiable structure. (2) As the largest static structure of the posterior knee, the oblique popliteal ligament is uniquely suited to act as a checkrein to knee hyperextension.Study DesignDescriptive laboratory study.MethodsTwenty fresh-frozen human knees were divided into 3 groups for a ligament sectioning study. Extension moments of 14 and 27 N·m were applied before and after sectioning of each ligament, and motion changes were recorded. In group 1, the oblique popliteal ligament was sectioned first, followed by the fabellofibular ligament, ligament of Wrisberg, anterior cruciate ligament, posterolateral structures, and posterior cruciate ligament. In group 2, the order was altered to section the anterior cruciate ligament first; no other changes were made. Similarly, the cutting order for group 3 was altered to section the pos...

TI  - Ligamentoplastie du croisé antérieur par allogreffe tendineuse congelée mixte intra- et extra-articulaire
PY  - 2004
AB  - Resume Cette etude retrospective rapporte et analyse les resultats d’une serie de ligamentoplasties palliatives du ligament croise anterieur par allogreffe congelee mixte intra- et extra-articulaire. Entre 1990 et 1995, le meme operateur a realise 92 ligamentoplasties du croise anterieur selon une technique originale. Tous les greffons comprenaient un fragment osseux qui permettait une fixation tibiale par une vis d’interference et leur longueur etait suffisante pour realiser une tenodese extra-articulaire. Le meme examinateur a pu evaluer 73 de ces 92 genoux selon les criteres IKDC avec un recul moyen de 4,5 ans (2 a 8 ans). L’âge moyen etait de 23,7 ans (9,8 a 43,8 ans). La serie comprenait 37 hemi-tendons d’Achille, 28 hemi-tendons patellaires et 8 tendons de muscle tibial anterieur ou posterieur en double faisceau. Les complications immediates ont ete limitees a un rejet de fil a la plaie et un hematome. Des complications differees ont justifie un total de 9 re-interventions dont 4 pour nouvelle lesion meniscale, 2 pour cyclope syndrome, une pour corps etranger, une pour instabilite et une pour douleurs. Il n’y a pas eu de synovite reactionnelle. Le resultat IKDC global a ete de 88 % de bons resultats (14 % A et 74 % B). Douze pour cent ont obtenu un mauvais resultat (11 % C et 1 % D). Le facteur pronostique principal a ete le delai entre l’accident et la ligamentoplastie palliative ; tous les patients operes entre 1 et 3 mois ont obtenu un bon resultat final (p = 0,003). 51 patients (70 %) ont repris le meme sport qu’avant l’intervention et au meme niveau ; des 22 patients n’ayant pas repris le meme sport, 12 en ont ete empeches par leur genou et 10 par d’autres raisons. La realisation systematique d’une tenodese laterale extra-articulaire n’a pas cause de limitation de mobilite ni cause de morbidite. L’utilisation d’allogreffe congelee a permis d’obtenir des resultats satisfaisants sans morbidite liee au prelevement d’une autogreffe.

TI  - Evaluation of Cartilage Injuries and Repair
PY  - 2003
AB  - Articular cartilage injuries ( Fig. 1 ) are common findings during arthroscopy 1 and diagnostic imaging of the joints 2,3. While there are many techniques for the treatment of cartilage injuries, not enough is known about which lesions need treatment or about the proper treatment modality for a particular lesion. More objective data regarding cartilage injuries and more accurate methods to evaluate the operative outcomes are required, especially since new procedures are becoming increasingly expensive. There are many published reports on the outcomes of total joint replacement based on clinical scores and radiographic evaluations. However, it has been quite difficult to interpret the reported results of the repair of focal cartilage defects as there is no universally accepted system to describe the lesions, the repair tissue, or the clinical symptoms for this category of patients. More studies on clinical articular cartilage resurfacing will appear in the future, making it important to develop common evaluation measurement tools and standards. The International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) was founded in 1997 and has been interested in developing a standardization system for the evaluation of cartilage injury and repair 4,5. A working group of the ICRS was established with the aim of developing a common, easy system for clinical and arthroscopic evaluation ( Table I ). Shortly thereafter, the Articular Cartilage Imaging Committee of the ICRS was created to assess the existing clinical imaging techniques, to recommend specific magnetic resonance imaging techniques for the assessment of articular cartilage 6, and to develop a standardized magnetic resonance imaging evaluation system for native and repaired cartilage ( Table I ). A state-of-the-art system for clinical cartilage evaluation and imaging assessment is presented below.

TI  - Combined Anterior Cruciate Ligament and Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction Decreases Passive Anterior Tibial Subluxation Compared With Isolated Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Despite Similar Rotational Stability and Clinical Outcomes.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">To analyze the effect of augmenting a hamstring autograft anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with an anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) on a primary outcome of passive anterior tibial subluxation (PATS) and a secondary outcome of the clinical outcomes.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">ACL-injured patients who underwent primary ACLR between March 2014 and February 2020 at our center were enrolled. Patients who underwent combined procedures (ACLR + ALLR) were matched in a 1:1 propensity ratio to patients who underwent ACLR only.

          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">From an initial cohort of 252 patients with a minimum follow-up period of 2 years (48.4 ± 16.6 months), 35 matched pairs were included, and 17 patients (48.6%) in each group underwent second-look arthroscopy. The combined ACLR + ALLR group showed significantly better improvement of PATS in the lateral compartments than the isolated ACLR group (P = .034). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding knee stability (side-to-side laxity difference, pivot-shift test), PROMs, complications, and second-look arthroscopic findings (all P &gt; .05). Moreover, the proportions of patients who achieved the minimal clinically important difference in PROMs were not different between groups.</AbstractText>

TI  - Medial Meniscal Tears and Spontaneous Osteonecrosis of the Knee
PY  - 2006
AB  - We report on a series of 5 patients over 60 years of age who had a symptomatic medial meniscus degenerative tear followed-up with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence without arthroscopic surgery who developed spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee. The average patients age was 68 years. Clinically, all 5 patients had tenderness at the medial joint line. At initial evaluation, MRI studies showed degenerative tears of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus with no evidence of osteonecrosis. After a mean time of 2.7 months, all patients had increased pain and were re-evaluated with a second MRI study that showed images compatible with osteonecrosis. The size of the osteonecrotic image shown on the MRI was measured, and values obtained averaged 21% of the femoral condyle with a range from 17% to 26%. Development of osteonecrosis after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy has been previously reported as a rare and unexpected complication. We report an MRI sequence between medial meniscus degenerative tears and the development of spontaneous osteonecrosis without any arthroscopic procedure. Elderly patients with medial meniscal tears should be alerted of this potential sequence of events and the impossibility for the surgeon to predict or prevent this situation at this stage, especially before performing an arthroscopic meniscectomy.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Autograft Choice: Bone-Tendon-Bone Versus Hamstring Does It Really Matter? A Systematic Review
PY  - 2004
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament graft choice is controversial, with no evidence-based consensus available to guide decision making. The study design was evidence-based medicine systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating patellar tendon versus hamstring tendon autografts. A literature review identified 9 randomized controlled trials comparing patellar tendon and hamstring tendon autografts. An evidence-based systematic review was performed. Objective and subjective outcomes of interest included surgical technique, rehabilitation, instrumented laxity, isokinetic strength, patellofemoral pain, return to preinjury activity, and Tegner, Lysholm, Cincinnati, and International Knee Documentation Committee-1991 scores. Additional surgery, graft failure, and complications were reviewed. Slight increased laxity on arthrometer testing was seen in the hamstring population in 3 of 7 studies. Pain with kneeling was greater for the patellar tendon population in 4 of 4 studies. Only 1 of 9 studies showed increased anterior knee pain in the patellar tendon group. Frequency of additional surgery seemed to be related to the fixation method and not graft type. No study reported a significant difference in graft failure between patellar tendon and hamstring tendon autografts. Objective differences (range of motion, isokinetic strength, arthrometer testing) were not detected between groups in the majority of studies, suggesting that their sensitivity to detect clinical outcomes may be limited. Increased kneeling pain in the patellar tendon group was seen consistently in the studies evaluated. Subjective differences in anterior knee pain or return-to-activity level were not consistently observed in these studies. With numbers available, failure rates were not significantly different between groups. These findings suggest that graft type may not be the primary determinant for successful outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament surgery.

TI  - Patellar Tendon or Semitendinosus Tendon Autografts for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Prospective, Randomized Study With a 7-Year Follow-up
PY  - 2007
AB  - Background: The aim of the study was to compare the results after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using central-third bone—patellar tendon—bone (BTB) autografts and triple/quadruple semitendinosus (ST) autografts.Hypothesis: In the long-term, ACL reconstruction using BTB autografts will render more donor-site problems than ST autografts.Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.Methods: A randomized series of 71 patients (22 women and 49 men) with a unilateral ACL rupture who underwent reconstructive surgery were included in the study. The BTB graft was used in 34 patients (BTB group) and the ST-tendon graft was used in 37 patients (ST group). The patients were examined a median of 86 months (range, 68 to 114 months) after the reconstruction.Results: Sixty-eight of 71 patients (96%) were examined at follow-up. The clinical assessments at follow-up revealed no significant differences between the BTB group and the ST group in terms of the Lysholm score, Teg...

TI  - Autograft Versus Nonirradiated Allograft Tissue for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background:An autograft has traditionally been the gold standard for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), but the use of allograft tissue has increased in recent years. While numerous studies have demonstrated that irradiated allografts are associated with increased failure rates, some report excellent results after ACLR with nonirradiated allografts. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine whether the use of nonirradiated allograft tissue is associated with poorer outcomes when compared with autografts.Hypothesis:Patients undergoing ACLR with autografts versus nonirradiated allografts will demonstrate no significant differences in graft failure risk, laxity on postoperative physical examination, or differences in patient-oriented outcome scores.Study Design:Systematic review.Methods:A systematic review was performed to identify prospective or retrospective comparative studies (evidence level 1, 2, or 3) of autografts versus nonirradiated allografts for ACLR.

TI  - Bone Contusions After Acute Noncontact Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Are Associated With Knee Joint Laxity, Concomitant Meniscal Lesions, and Anterolateral Ligament Abnormality
PY  - 2016
AB  - Purpose To examine the associated findings with bone contusions in patients after acute noncontact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Methods From January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, patients who underwent ACL reconstructions performed by the senior author (H.F.) were retrospectively analyzed. Presence and severity of bone contusion were determined from preoperative magnetic resonance images (MRIs) for each anatomic site including the lateral femoral condyle (LFC), lateral tibial plateau (LTP), medial femoral condyle (MFC), and medial tibial plateau (MTP). Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associated findings (demographic data, preoperative physical examinations, concomitant meniscal lesions, intra-articular cartilage damages, and anterolateral ligament [ALL] abnormality) with bone contusions. Outcomes included the presence of bone contusions at each anatomic site (LFC, LTP, MFC, and MTP) and severity of lateral bone contusions (moderate/severe vs none/minimal). Results Among the 697 consecutive cases, 193 were finally selected. Prevalence of bone contusions seen on MRI was as follows: 60.6% LFC, 73.1% LTP, 6.2% MFC, and 21.2% MTP. Presence of bone contusions at LFC and LTP were significantly associated with high-grade (grade II and III) pivot-shift (OR LFC , 7.39; 95% CI, 1.99, 27.44; OR LTP , 2.52; 95% CI, 1.02, 6.24), concomitant lateral meniscal lesions (OR LFC , 3.23; 95% CI, 1.93, 11.31; OR LTP , 10.17; 95% CI, 1.86, 55.47), and ALL abnormality (OR LFC , 3.79; 95% CI, 1.46, 9.84; OR LTP , 4.47; 95% CI, 1.28, 15.58). However, none of the above associated findings was correlated with the presence of bone contusions at MFC and MTP. Furthermore, moderate/severe lateral bone contusions were still found to be significantly associated with high-grade (grade II and III) pivot-shift (OR LFC , 14.89; 95% CI, 2.71, 82.11; OR LTP , 6.76; 95% CI, 1.27, 36.06), concomitant lateral meniscal lesions (OR LFC , 17.34; 95% CI, 3.91, 76.87; OR LTP , 22.01; 95% CI, 5.08, 95.42), and ALL abnormality (OR LFC , 4.02; 95% CI, 1.33, 12.09; OR LTP , 2.57; 95% CI, 1.09, 6.04). Conclusions For acute noncontact ACL injury, both the presence and the severity of lateral bone contusions are associated with high-grade (grade II and III) pivot-shift, concomitant lateral meniscal lesions, and ALL abnormality. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative study.

TI  - Is local platelet-rich plasma injection clinically superior to hyaluronic acid for treatment of knee osteoarthritis? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
PY  - 2018
AB  - In this study, we evaluated whether platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is superior to hyaluronic acid (HA) in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched for English-language, human in vivo studies on the treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis with intra-articular PRP compared with HA. The following keywords were used for the search: “platelet-rich plasma,” “PRP,” “platelet-rich fibrin,” “PRF,” “platelet,” “plasma,” “arthritis,” “osteoarthritis,” “gonarthrosis,” and “degeneration.” Seven articles reporting 908 patients and 908 knees were analyzed, including 44% men and 56% women with a mean age of 59.8 years. All studies met the minimal clinically important difference criteria and showed statistically significant improvements in clinical outcomes, including pain, physical function, and stiffness, with PRP treatment. All except two studies showed significant differences between PRP and HA regarding clinical outcomes of pain and function. PRP intra-articular injection of the knee may be an effective alternative treatment for knee OA, especially in patients with mild knee OA. Although some studies suggested that the effect of PRP was no better than HA, we found that it was no worse. A large, multicenter, randomized trial is needed to further assess the efficacy of PRP treatment for patients with knee OA. PROSPERO, CRD42016048394

TI  - Long-Term Outcome of ACL Reconstruction
PY  - 2014
AB  - The occurrence of osteoarthritis (OA) is often thought of as a near-inevitable long-term consequence of ACL injury, with prevalences of 50–80 % reported a decade after the initial trauma [18, 36]. In this view, ACL tears are often quoted as being responsible for a large percentage of the “young patients with old knees,” [18, 37] irrespective of the treatment method. Although surgical ACL reconstruction using tendon grafts has become the current standard of care to treat the functionally unstable ACL-deficient knee [36], controversy remains to exist regarding the effect of ACL reconstruction on the development of knee OA in this generally young population. Current literature contains a number of reports suggesting that the prevalence of OA remains unchanged whether or not the ACL is surgically reconstructed [14, 19], but Daniel et al. [4] even detected an increased incidence of OA in the ACL-reconstructed group. On the other end of the spectrum, some authors seem to maintain excellent results a decade after ACL reconstruction, with reported OA prevalences of 2–3 % [14, 29].

TI  - Long-term outcome of patients treated surgically for traumatic knee dislocation : does the injury pattern matter?
PY  - 2010
AB  - AbstractAims: To examine the difference in outcomes of patients treated surgically for traumatic knee dislocation with regard to different injury patterns. Methods: All patients who underwent reconstruction/repair of the cruciates and primary complete repair of collaterals, posterolateral, and posteromedial corner structures were allocated to 3 groups (group A: bicruciate injury with associated medial side injury [n = 31]; group B: bicruciate injury with associated lateral injury [n = 20]; group C: bicruciate injury with associated medial and lateral injury [n = 23]). Outcome was assessed at a mean of 12 years postoperatively using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey, Lysholm score, Tegner score, visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, and Knee Society score. Anterior-posterior laxity was also measured (KT1000™ arthrometer; Medmetric Corp., San Diego, CA), and Pearson's correlation was used to compute associations between variables (P < 0.05). Res...

TI  - Clinical comparisons between the transtibial technique and the far anteromedial portal technique for posterolateral femoral tunnel drilling in anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical results of the transtibial and far anteromedial portal techniques for posterolateral (PL) femoral tunnel drilling in double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods This study involved 50 patients who underwent double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and were followed up for more than 2 years. The anteromedial bundle was reconstructed with the far anteromedial portal technique in all patients. However, the PL bundle was reconstructed with the transtibial and far anteromedial portal techniques in 22 patients (group T) and 28 patients (group F), respectively. The follow-up visits included evaluation of Lysholm knee scores, KT-2000 measurement of anterior knee laxity (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), the pivot-shift test, and radiography. Results The length of the PL femoral tunnel in group F (32.2 mm) was significantly shorter than that in group T (39.0 mm). Lateral knee radiographs showed that the positions of the EndoButtons (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy, Andover, MA) for the PL bundles were significantly more posterior (12.8 mm) and distal (3.1 mm) in group F than in group T. The mean KT-2000 side-to-side difference in group T (0.9 mm) and group F (0.7 mm) did not significantly differ. In addition, no significant difference was noted between the groups with respect to Lysholm knee scores and the pivot-shift test results. Conclusions This study showed that the far anteromedial portal technique is as effective as the transtibial technique and results in good restoration of joint stability and knee scores despite shorter femoral tunnel length and inferoposterior position of the EndoButton. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative study.

TI  - A prospective randomized study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a comparison of patellar tendon and quadruple-strand semitendinosus/gracilis tendons fixed with bioabsorbable interference screws.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Background: Debate exists regarding the optimal graft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Few studies have compared the differences in outcome after reconstruction using similar fixation methods.Hypothesis: Similar outcomes will be seen after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone or quadruple-strand semitendinosus/gracilis tendons fixed with bioabsorbable interference screws.Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.Methods: Ninety-nine patients were prospectively randomized to bone-patellar tendon-bone (46 patients) or quadruple-strand semitendinosus/gracilis (53 patients) reconstruction groups. The bone-patellar tendon-bone group had slightly lower preinjury Tegner scores (6.7 vs 7.1, P = .03); otherwise, the groups were similar. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon using an endoscopic technique with bioabsorbable interference screw fixation. Patients were evaluated at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.Results: Forty-six bone-patellar...

TI  - Influence of age, gender, and injury mechanism on the development of dynamic knee stability after acute ACL rupture.
PY  - 2007
AB  - The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most frequently injured ligament in the knee and is often injured during athletic activities.3,20 The majority of individuals cannot return to high-level athletic activities after ACL rupture because of continued episodes of knee giving-way (noncopers).5,8 Consequently, early surgical intervention is the preferred treatment for the majority of orthopaedic surgeons in the United States.7,21 There are, however, a small percentage of individuals with a complete ACL tear who are able to successfully compensate for the absence of the ACL. Copers are operationally defined as individuals who have asymptomatically returned to all preinjury activities, including sports, for at least 1 year.5,29 It is a significant clinical challenge to identify individuals who have the potential to compensate well for ACL deficiency early after injury, when patient management decisions are often made.

A screening examination has been developed that discriminates between noncopers and individuals with good potential to cope nonoperatively with ACL deficiency (potential copers).9 The screening examination9 consists of a battery of clinical tests and measures that capture dynamic knee stability (ie, the ability of a joint to remain stable when subjected to rapidly changing loads during activities)30 and may be administered early after injury. Fitzgerald9 validated the screening examination with a series of 93 consecutive patients with acute, isolated ACL rupture. Thirty-nine patients (42%) met the criteria for classification as appropriate rehabilitation candidates (potential copers). Of the 28 potential copers who elected nonoperative management, 79% were able to return to preinjury activity levels for a 6-month period without experiencing further giving-way episodes, reduction in activity status, or extension of the original knee injury.9 These results indicate that the screening examination is an efective clinical tool for identifying highly active patients with different levels of dynamic knee stability early after ACL rupture.

Neuromuscular system responses after ACL rupture dictate in large part which patients are able to maintain dynamic knee stability in the absence of ligamentous support. There is evidence suggesting that some populations may not be able to adequately compensate for ACL deficiency. Individuals who sustain a noncontact ACL rupture may have compromised neuromuscular control. In this scenario, ligament rupture occurs as internal forces exceed ligament tensile properties. A failure of lower extremity muscle control (eg, delayed contractions or altered muscle recruitment order) during provocative activities such as jumping, cutting, and pivoting can increase the demand on the static joint stabilizers and lead to ACL rupture. Or, in the patient with ACL deficiency, inadequate muscle control may result in a giving-way episode. The mechanism underlying contact ACL injuries is quite different. Simply, the knee is exposed to an external load, produced by another person or object, that exceeds the tensile properties of the ligament.

Highly active female athletes and older adults also exhibit neuromuscular characteristics that suggest that these individuals may not be able to successfully compensate for ACL deficiency. In comparison to male athletes, females produce less muscle stiffness,31,32 recruit quadriceps (an ACL antagonist) before hamstring (an ACL agonist) muscles,14,15,33 and have delayed hamstring reactions in response to anterior stress on the ACL.15 Age-related changes in neuromuscular performance have also been documented. Decreases in joint position sense,16,19,27 slower muscle response time,18 and slower time to peak torque18 have been reported in older versus younger populations. Most studies evaluating the influence of age on neuromuscular performance include age groups not associated with ACL injuries. Regression in neuromuscular performance, however, would occur across a continuum and not at a specific age. Therefore, the risk for experiencing knee instability after ACL rupture may increase with age.

Identifying populations at risk for experiencing knee instability after ACL rupture may provide surgeons and rehabilitation clinicians with important information about patient demographics and functional characteristics that help guide patient management, and may provide further insight to the development of dynamic knee stability. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of age, gender, and mechanism of injury on the restoration of dynamic knee stability after ACL rupture. We hypothesized that (1) more females would be classified as noncopers than potential copers, (2) more individuals who sustained a noncontact ACL injury would be classified as noncopers than potential copers, (3) more individuals who sustained a noncontact injury would be classified as noncopers than males and females who were injured by contact, and (4) there would be a greater proportion of noncopers than potential copers across all age groups, with the greatest difference occurring in individuals categorized as older adults.

TI  - Shared ACL Bone Tunnel Technique for Repair of Lateral Meniscus Posterior Root Tears Combined With ACL Reconstruction.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Independent transtibial pullout repair is a common surgical technique for repairing lateral meniscus posterior root tears (LMPRTs). The shared anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) bone tunnel technique is an alternative technique for LMPRT repair combined with ACL reconstruction (ACLR) to avoid the establishment of additional bone tunnels.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Purpose" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To compare the clinical outcomes of the shared ACL bone tunnel versus the independent transtibial pullout techniques for LMPRT repair combined with ACLR.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Study Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Between March 2014 and February 2018, a total of 48 patients were diagnosed with ACL injury with concomitant LMPRT; 22 patients underwent independent transtibial pullout repair (group T), and 26 patients underwent the shared ACL bone tunnel technique (group S). At a follow-up of &gt;2 years, we compared knee functional recovery using the Lysholm, Tegner, and International Knee Documentation Committee scores and the pivot-shift test. Lateral meniscal extrusion, and cartilage degeneration on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were also compared. The healing status of the lateral meniscus posterior root was compared using second-look arthroscopy and MRI.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The duration of surgery was significantly shorter in group S compared with group T (98.3 ± 11.1 vs 127.9 ± 17.5 min; <i>P</i> = .001). At final follow-up, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in knee functional scores, pivot shift, or grade of cartilage degeneration. Lateral meniscal extrusion was decreased in group S compared with group T (2.41 ± 0.61 vs 1.59 ± 1.35 mm; <i>P</i> = .014). Second-look arthroscopy revealed stable healing in 16 of 18 patients (88.9%) in group S and 10 of 15 patients (66.7%) in group T (<i>P</i> = .38).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Both the shared ACL bone tunnel and the independent transtibial pullout techniques led to satisfactory clinical outcomes. The shared ACL bone tunnel technique is the simpler of the 2 procedures for combined LMPRT repair with ACLR.</AbstractText>

TI  - Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis (AMIC) and AMIC Enhanced by Autologous Concentrated Bone Marrow Aspirate (BMAC) Allow for Stable Clinical and Functional Improvements at up to 9 Years Follow-Up: Results from a Randomized Controlled Study.
PY  - 2019
AB  - The aims of the study were to evaluate long-term outcomes after autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) in the treatment of focal chondral lesions and to assess the possible improvements given by the combination of this technique with bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC). Twenty-four patients (age range 18–55 years) affected by focal knee chondral lesions were treated with standard AMIC or AMIC enhanced by BMAC (AMIC+). Pain (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)) and functional scores (Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)) were collected pre-operatively and then at 6, 12, 24, 60, and 100 months after treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation was performed pre-operatively and at 6, 12, and 24 months follow-ups. Patients treated with AMIC+ showed higher Lysholm scores (p = 0.015) and lower VAS (p = 0.011) in comparison with patients in the standard AMIC group at the 12 months follow-up. Both treatments allowed for functional and pain improvements with respect to pre-operative levels lasting up to 100 months. MRI revealed consistent cartilage repair at 24 months in both groups. This study shows that AMIC and AMIC+ are effective treatments for focal chondral lesions with beneficial effect lasting up to 9 years. AMIC+ allows for faster recovery from injury, and is thus more indicated for patients requiring a prompt return to activity. Level of evidence: II, randomized controlled trial in an explorative cohort.

TI  - Monopolar thermal treatment of symptomatic anterior cruciate ligament instability.
PY  - 2003
AB  - Patients with anterior cruciate ligament instability resulting from incomplete tears or elongation in continuity without ligament detachment historically have been treated conservatively or by graft replacement. The literature is sparse regarding alternative treatments. The current study presents experience using monopolar thermal repair on 28 consecutive knees with partial anterior cruciate ligament tears all symptomatically unstable. All lesions were less than 6 months old (average, 77 days; range, 7-180 days) and with a difference of 6 mm or more (average, 9 mm; range, 6-13 mm) when comparing both knees using KT-1000 evaluation. Incomplete tears of the anterior cruciate ligament were seen at arthroscopic evaluation. The rehabilitation protocol included use of a brace for at least 6 weeks and progressive weightbearing. A 2-year minimum followup (range, 24-35 months) was done in all patients following the International Knee Documentation Committee guidelines. The overall outcome was normal or nearly normal in 96% of the patients. One failure occurred at 8 weeks. Twenty-six knees had a KT-1000 difference between 0 and 2 mm (average, 1.9 mm). Because thermal application causes death to some of the cells directly treated, it should be taken into account in selection and application. Immediately after thermal use, the anterior cruciate ligament, although thicker and tighter, is at first weaker than normal. Rehabilitation and compliance are critical during early ligament healing. This procedure seems to be a reasonable alternative to anterior cruciate ligament grafting in selected patients.

TI  - The Impact of Transphyseal Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction on Lower Extremity Growth and Alignment.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the effect of transphyseal anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction on lower extremity radiographic growth and alignment. Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent transphyseal ACL reconstruction and were followed to skeletal maturity or at least 2 years, with the nonoperative limb used as an internal control. Changes in coronal plane alignments and tibial slope of the operative limb were compared with a Wilcoxon test. Associations among sex, tunnel, and graft characteristics and failure; changes in coronal plane measures and tunnel size; and tunnel angles and the development of deformity were examined by χ-square and correlation coefficients. Results Fifty-nine patients (41 boys and 18 girls) underwent surgery at a mean age of 12.5 years (range, 6.8-16.0 years). There were differences in changes in the mechanical lateral distal femoral angle comparing operative and nonoperative limbs (decreased 1.1° in girls and 1.9° in boys ≤13 years of age, P = .0008 and .025, respectively) and in changes in tibial slope of the operative limb (decreased 2.1° in male patients >13 years, P = .012). No patient developed a new limb length difference >1 cm. Two boys were treated for deformities. Eight additional patients developed >5° difference in alignment for a rate of radiologic deformity of 10 of 59 or 17%. Neither graft failure nor the presence of deformity was associated with sex, tunnel size, mode of femoral tunnel positioning, inclination of tunnels, or the use of allograft. Conclusions Radiographically evident limb deformities following transphyseal ACL reconstruction occurred at a rate of 17%, although these deformities were clinically evident in only 5% of patients. Tunnels intersecting physes near cortical margins may increase the risk of developing deformity. Regular follow-up should include alignment radiographs to detect deformities despite the clinical appearance of neutral limb alignment. Level of Evidence Level III, case-control study.

PY  - 2009
AB  - Background:The return to sporting activities after ankle arthroplasty has rarely been evaluated. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate function and return to sports after total ankle arthroplasty.Materials and Methods:One hundred seventy-nine Salto Total Ankle Arthroplasties (TAA) were implanted between 1997 and 2005. A self-administered questionnaire including the Foot Function Index (FFI) and Foot and Ankle Ability Measurement (FAAM) was sent to all patients. At last followup, six were deceased, 22 were not available for evaluation, and six questionnaires were incomplete. One hundred forty-five questionnaires were available. The mean age was 60.9 years and the mean followup was 53.8 months. The main indications for TAA were osteoarthritis (OA) in 100 cases and Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 40 cases.Results:15.2% of the patients said that their operated ankle was “normal”; 60.7% “nearly normal”; 20% “abnormal” and 4.1% “highly abnormal.” The FFI scores were 13.7 ± 17 for “activity limitations”,...

TI  - Epidemiology and Natural History of Acute Patellar Dislocation
PY  - 2004
AB  - BackgroundThe goals of this study were to (1) define the epidemiology of acute patellar dislocation, (2) determine the risk of subsequent patellar instability episodes (subluxation and/or redislocation) during the study period, and (3) identify risk factors for subsequent instability episodes.Study DesignProspective cohort study.MethodsThe authors prospectively followed 189 patients for a period of 2 to 5 years. Historical data, injury mechanisms, and physical and radiographic measurements were recorded to identify potential risk factors for poor outcomes.ResultsRisk was highest among females 10 to 17 years old. Patients presenting with a prior history of instability were more likely to be female (P < .05) and were older than first-time dislocation patients (P < .05). Fewer first-time dislocators (17%) had episodes of instability during follow-up than patients with a previous history of instability (49%) (P < .01). After adjusting for demographics, patients with a prior history had 7 times higher odds of ...

TI  - Does Internal Fixation for Unstable Osteochondritis Dissecans of the Skeletally Mature Knee Work? A Systematic Review.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Purpose To report the rate of radiographic union, patient-reported outcomes, complications, and reoperations after internal fixation of unstable osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) in the skeletally mature knee. Methods A literature search was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Patients were included if they were skeletally mature and underwent internal fixation of an unstable OCD lesion of the knee. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies scoring system. Surgical technique, rate of union, patient-reported outcomes, complications, and reoperations were collected. Results Thirteen studies resulted in 148 patients (150 knees) for inclusion. Patient age ranged from 14 to 45 years. Numerous fixation procedures were used, including biodegradable devices (rods, pins, nails, and screws), metal screws, Kirschner wire, and autologous bone sticks. Overall, reported outcome measures were heterogeneous in nature. The rate of radiographic healing ranged from 67% to 100% across 6 studies. Improved subjective results and Hughston criteria on final follow-up ranged from 83% to 100% across 4 studies each. Mean postoperative Lysholm scores ranged from 42 to 98 in studies that reported them. Both complication and reoperation rates ranged from 0% to 44%. The most commonly performed reoperations were loose body excision and cartilage resurfacing procedures. Conclusions A variety of surgical techniques are available for treatment of unstable OCD lesions in the skeletally mature knee. In this systematic review, internal fixation of the native fragment showed acceptable rates of radiographic union and improved patient-reported outcomes relative to other techniques. Level of Evidence Level IV, systematic review of level III-IV studies.

TI  - Transphyseal Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in the Skeletally Immature Follow-up to a Minimum of Sixteen Years of Age
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background: The evidence in favor of early surgical treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in children is increasing. However, the controversy regarding the safety of such a procedure in young athletes with wide open physes remains unresolved.

Methods: We reviewed prospectively collected outcome data on consecutive patients who had undergone transphyseal ACL reconstruction at either (1) an age of less than fourteen years and Tanner stage 1 or 2, or (2) an age of less than twelve years and Tanner stage 3. Children who had less than four years of follow-up, who were younger than sixteen years at the time of final follow-up, or who had been at Tanner stage 4 at the time of surgery were excluded. Twenty-eight of the thirty-two included patients had been at Tanner stage 1 or 2 at the time of surgery, and the remaining four had been at Tanner stage 3 but had been younger than twelve years of age. The mean age at the time of the surgery was 11.25 years (range, 9.5 to 14.0 years; median, 12.1 years). The mean duration of follow-up was 72.3 months (range, forty-eight to 129 months; median, seventy-two months).

Results: The mean Lysholm score improved from 71.5 preoperatively to 95.86 postoperatively (p < 0.0001). The mean Tegner activity scale score improved from 4.03 to 7.66 (p < 0.0001), which was comparable with the preinjury score of 8.0. One patient had a mild valgus deformity with no functional disturbance, and none had a limb-length discrepancy. One rerupture occurred, but all other patients had a good or excellent outcome.

Conclusions: This case series indicates good long-term results of ACL reconstruction with use of a transphyseal technique in young children.

Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Comparison of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with preservation only versus remnant tensioning technique
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the stability and functional outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction by tensioning of the ACL remnant using pullout sutures compared with a remnant preservation technique only. Methods The data of 33 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction by a remnant tensioning technique (tensioning group) were reviewed retrospectively and compared with the data of 43 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with remnant preservation without tensioning (preservation-only group) from September 2004 to April 2008 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. The stability and function were assessed from the side-to-side difference with a KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) and Telos device (Austin & Associates, Fallston, MD), as well as International Knee Documentation Committee and Orthopadische Arbeitsgruppe Knie scores. Results There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to the subjective and objective International Knee Documentation Committee scores ( P = .808 and P = .152, respectively) and Orthopadische Arbeitsgruppe Knie score ( P = .702) at the last follow-up. No significant differences in mechanical stability were observed with the KT-1000 arthrometer and stress radiographs between the groups ( P = .650 and P = .791, respectively). The remnant tensioning group took a longer surgical time than the preservation-only group (156.4 minutes v 134.5 minutes, P = .117). Conclusions The ACL remnant tensioning procedure did not improve the final results of an ACL reconstruction in terms of the clinical function and stability compared with an ACL reconstruction using the preservation-only technique.

TI  - No significant improvement in neuromuscular proprioception and increased reliance on visual compensation 6 months after ACL reconstruction
PY  - 2021
AB  - To determine the contributions of proprioceptive and visual feedbacks for postural control at 6 months following ACLR, and to determine their associations with knee laxity, isokinetic tests and clinical scores. Level IV, Case series. Fifty volunteers who received ACLR between May 2015 and January 2017 were prospectively enrolled, and at 6 months following ACLR, postural stability was assessed. Somatosensory ratios (somatic proprioception), and visual ratios (visual compensation), were calculated to evaluate the use of sensory inputs for postural control. Univariable regression analyses were performed to determine associations of somatosensory and visual ratios with knee laxity, isokinetic tests and clinical scores. At 6 months following ACLR, the somatosensory ratio did not change, while the visual ratio decreased significantly from 5.73 ± 4.13 to 3.07 ± 1.96 (p = 0.002), indicating greater reliance on visual cues to maintain balance. Univariable analyses revealed that the somatosensory ratio was significantly lower for patients who performed aquatic therapy (β = -0.50; p = 0.045), but was not associated with knee laxity, muscle strength or clinical scores. An increased visual ratio was associated with patients who received hamstrings tendon autografts (β = 1.32; p = 0.049), but was not associated with knee laxity, muscle strength or clinical scores. At 6 months following ACLR, visual ratios decreased significantly, while somatosensory ratios did not change. This may suggest that there is little or no improvement in neuromuscular proprioception and therefore greater reliance on visual cues to maintain balance. The clinical relevance of this study is that posturography can provide useful information to help research following ACLR and to predict successful return to play.

TI  - A Comparison of Operative and Nonoperative Treatment of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Intention to resume high-risk sports activity is a major motivating factor for patients who elect anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction rather than nonoperative treatment. Some patients are able to cope with an ACL-deficient knee and resume preinjury activity levels, including level-1 sports (football, basketball, soccer, etc.), following nonoperative treatment; however, activity levels correlate with injury risk in ACL-deficient knees. Patients who have an ACL injury along with concomitant meniscal injury are at increased risk for osteoarthritis. It is unclear what effect reconstruction of an isolated ACL injury has on future osteoarthritis risk in ACL-deficient patients who are identified as "copers." There are distinct biomechanical differences between copers and noncopers, but no reliable screening tools are currently able to predict which patients will become copers following nonoperative treatment of an ACL injury. A trial of nonoperative treatment, including perturbation exercises, to determine whether reconstruction is needed does not increase the risk of additional knee injury.

Along with a traditional rehabilitation protocol, the BFRT group completed a standardized BFRT protocol (3 BFRT exercises performed twice weekly for the initial 12 weeks postoperatively). Peak torque values for isometric knee extension and flexion strength (at 3 months and RTS) and isokinetic strength at 180 deg/s (at RTS) as well as Pediatric International Knee Documentation Committee (Pedi-IKDC) scores were collected.

TI  - Factors Related to Return to Sport After ACL Reconstruction: When Is It Safe?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Current clinical practice permits patients to return to sport at between 6 and 12 months postoperatively. There is high-quality evidence to indicate that most patients (93 %) do attempt some form of sport after surgery. However, it appears that, at best, only approximately 60 % return to their pre-injury level of sports participation. There are many factors that may influence when it is safe to return to sport, and many criteria have been used to guide the patient and treating health professional. However, the validity of such criteria remains to be established. Similarly, there may be aspects of graft healing that influence safety in return to sport, but these are yet to be fully explored in vivo. The health of other structures in the knee must also be considered when making return-to-play decisions. The clinician should ask the following: Is it safe for the ACL graft, and is it safe for the health of the whole knee for the patient to return to sport at this time?

TI  - Rehabilitation following bone-patellar tendon-bone graft ACL reconstruction
PY  - 2006
AB  - The aim was to study possible relations between anterior knee laxity, knee function, personality and return to sports. Another aim was to check whether knee instability could distinguish patients that returned to pre-injury activity level after ACL reconstruction from those that did not. The study comprised 49 physically active patients that had undergone ACL reconstruction on average 7,2 years earlier. All patients had been evaluated with KT- 1000 after their surgery and postoperative rehabilitation. Anterior knee laxity was assessed with the KT-1000, functional outcome with Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and personality with Swedish universities Scales of Personality (SSP). All patients showed a more stable knee joint at the follow-up (p measurement a tendency was that the group that returned to sports at pre-injury level was more stable, measured with KT-1000, than those who did not (p=0.088). These patients also had a significantly better functional outcome (KOOS) and a lower degree of Somatic Trait Anxiety (p=0.01), Psychic Trait Anxiety (p=0.001) and Stress Susceptibility (p=0.003) (SSP). Thus, return to sports may be more related to personality characteristics than to instrumented anterior knee laxity. Key words ACL injury, functional outcome, KOOS, KT-1000 arthrometer, personality characteristics, physical activity.

TI  - Relationship between Isokinetic Strengths, Subjective Knee Scores, and Functional Performance after ACL Reconstruction
PY  - 2015
AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between isokinetic strengths, subjective knee scores, and functional performance in patients with an ACL-reconstructed knee. [Methods] Fifty-five male patients between the ages of 16~53 years were enrolled in this study. At the time of testing, a mean 19.7 months had elapsed since the patients had received ACL reconstruction. Muscle strength of the affected knee was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer at the following velocities; 60, 180, 240°/s. The patients scored their affected knee function using 3 subjective knee scores: Lysholm, IKDC, and the Tegner Scores. Functional performance of the affected knee was measured using the one leg hop test for distance. [Results] Isokinetic measurements showed a significant correlation only with the Tegner score. At 60°/s, peak torque (r=.322, p<.05) and peak torque to weight ratio, also written as peak torque % body weight (r=.395, p<.01), were positively correlated with the Tegner score. At 180°/s, peak torque % body weight (r=.336, p<.05), total work (r=.354, p<.05), and total work % body weight (r=.400, p<.01) were positively correlated with the Tegner score. At 240°/s, peak torque % body weight (r=.304, p<.05), total work (r=.318, p<.05), and total work % body weight (r=.331, p<.05) were positively correlated. At 60°/s, all isokinetic measurements for both extensors and flexors were significantly correlated with the functional performance of that knee (p<.01), of which the total work % body weight showed the strongest correlation (r=.600, p<.001). At 180°/s, all isokinetic measurements, except for total work by flexor muscles, were significantly correlated with functional performance (p<.05). At 240°/s, all isokinetic measurements were significantly correlated with functional performance (p<.05). [Conclusion] The clinical information derived from measuring total work, as a reflection of knee function, has been undervalued and is as good as that derived from peak torque.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of contemporary lateral augmentation techniques in primary ACL reconstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this investigation was to systematically review the contemporary literature to determine if a lateral augmentation (LA) added to an Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR) provides better clinical and patient reported outcomes compared to an isolated ACLR. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Two authors independently conducted an electronic search using MEDLINE® and Embase® on February 6th, 2021 for level I-III randomized controlled trials (RCT) and prospective cohort studies without randomization, published after 2012 and with a minimum of two year follow-up. Publications were included when they reported on the objective knee stability examination, patient reported outcome scores, return to sports or graft rupture rate of any type of primary, isolated ACLR compared to ACLR combined with any type of LA. Results A total of 11 studies that reported on a combined total of 1892 unique patients were eligible for data extraction, including five RCTs and six prospective cohort studies. In 6 studies, an Anterolateral Ligament reconstruction (ALLR) was the LA of choice, while the 5 other publications used different types of Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis (LET). A significant reduction in graft ruptures was found in patients treated with ACLR + LA (3%) compared to isolated ACLR (12%). Rotational laxity was significantly higher in isolated ACLR (14%) compared to ACLR + LA (6%). Addition of a LA reduced anterior translation when assessed via instrumented laxity testing. No significant difference was found in the patient reported outcome scores (IKDC and Tegner) between both patient groups, except for the Lysholm Score which was significant in favour of the ACLR + LA group. Conclusion Combination of a primary ACLR with a LA can significantly reduce the risk of graft rupture and provide better rotatory stability, without jeopardizing patient reported outcomes. Level of evidence Level III, Systematic Review of Level I, II and III studies.

TI  - Sensorimotor changes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2000
AB  - The restoration of joint stability is unlikely to be dependent on passive properties of the joint alone, yet the effect of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery on the sensorimotor system largely remains unexplored. This study evaluated whether surgical reconstruction of the ligament had any effect on one indicator of sensorimotor function, hamstring contraction latency, which previously has been shown to be related to function. Twenty-five patients with unilateral chronic anterior cruciate ligament deficiency had measures of hamstring contraction latency obtained before and after (3 and 6 months) reconstruction. After surgery, the contraction latency difference was found to improve significantly (decrease) in patients who had a preexisting deficit. The mechanism for alteration in response time remains unclear, but an observed relationship between contraction latency and tibial translation supports a mechanical basis for the findings. It was concluded the sensorimotor changes associated with surgical reconstruction of the cruciate ligament may help to restore joint stability. The study highlights the need to appreciate sensorimotor consequences of cruciate ligament surgery.

TI  - Is magnetic resonance imaging reliable in predicting clinical outcome after articular cartilage repair of the knee? A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background: While MRI can provide a detailed morphological evaluation after articular cartilage repair, its additional value in determining clinical outcome has yet to be determined. 

Purpose: To evaluate the correlation between MRI and clinical outcome after cartilage repair and to identify parameters that are most important in determining clinical outcome. 

Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. 

Methods: A systematic search was performed in Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Collaboration. Articles were screened for relevance and appraised for quality. Guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) Statement were used. Chi-square tests were performed to find variables that could determine correlation between clinical and radiological parameters. 

Results: A total of 32 articles (total number of patients, 1019) were included. A majority (81%) were case series or cohort studies that used similar standardized MRI techniques. The mean Coleman score was 63 (range, 42-96). For the majority of MRI parameters, limited or no correlation was found. Nine studies (28%) found a correlation between clinical outcome and the composite magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) or Henderson score and 7 (22%) with defect fill. In 5 studies, a weak to moderate correlation was found between clinical outcome and the T2 index (mean Pearson coefficient r = .53). 

Conclusion: Strong evidence to determine whether morphological MRI is reliable in predicting clinical outcome after cartilage repair is lacking. Future research aiming specifically at clinical sensitivity of advanced morphological and biochemical MRI techniques after articular cartilage repair could be of great importance to the field.

TI  - Revision ACL reconstruction using doubled semitendinosus and gracilis tendons: a follow-up study
PY  - 2004
AB  - Few papers report the results of revision ACL reconstruction with hamstrings tendons. We report our results with revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery using a doubled gracilis and semitendinosus tendons (DGST) graft, in association with an exta-articular procedure. Twelve patients underwent ACL revision surgery using autogenous homolateral DGST graft in association with an extra-articular procedure and were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 35 months. At follow-up evaluation, all patients scored negatively on the Lachman test and normally or near normally on the jerk test. The KT 1000 evaluation showed a average side-to-side difference at 30 lb and MM of 1.4±1.7 mm and 1.6±1.6 mm, respectively. The Lysholm score was 98±2 (range, 94–100); excellent results (score 95–100) were obtained in 83% of cases, good results (score 84–94) in 17%, and no fair or poor results. At the IKDC evaluation, the result was excellent (normal) in one-thirds of cases and good (nearly normal) in twothirds. Therefore, the use of hamstring tendons in association with lateral tenodesis seems to be a good alternative to the use of allografts or contralateral bone-patellar tendon-bone graft in revision ACL reconstructions.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Background
Controversy persists regarding the protocol for tensioning and securing the grafts in one-stage reconstruction of combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries. Many authors have reported stability examinations and functional results after reconstruction for this relatively rare injury, and the best sequence for tensioning the grafts is not known.

TI  - Fate of the anterior cruciate ligament-injured knee
PY  - 2002
AB  - Most patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries do well with activities of daily living even after follow-up in the range of 5 to 15 years. Most can participate in some sports activity if they are inclined to do so, but most will have some limitations in vigorous sports, and only a few will be entirely asymptomatic. The challenge to the clinician is to understand and predict how ACL deficiency in a given patient will affect that patients's life and activities. In counseling patients about treatment after an ACL injury, the clinician can use knee ligament arthrometry measurements and pre-injury sports activity to estimate the risk of injury over the next 5 to 10 years. Meniscus, chondral, and sub-chondral injuries are not uncommon, but rarely require surgical intervention in the early phase of ACL deficiency. The prevalence of clinically significant meniscal damage increases with time, and is associated with increasing disability, surgery, and arthrosis in high-risk patients. Ligament reconstruction has not been shown to prevent arthrosis, but in prospective studies it appears to reduce the risk of subsequent meniscal injury, improve passive anteroposterior knee motion limits, and facilitate return to high-level sporting activities.

TI  - Development and validation of health-related quality of life measures for the knee.
PY  - 2002
AB  - Health-related quality of life is an individual's perception of his or her health and it is an important outcome measure for clinical research in orthopaedics. For clinical outcomes research related to the knee, measures of health-related quality of life should consider disability imposed by impairment of the knee. Health-related quality of life is measured by assembling questions to represent the construct of health-related quality of life. Validation of health-related quality of life requires evidence to support the interpretation and usefulness of the resulting score. The purpose of the current paper was to provide readers with a framework for identifying and selecting relevant clinical outcome measures that should be considered when designing clinical research related to the knee. The need to include reliable, valid, and responsive measures of health-related quality of life in clinical outcomes research related to the knee was discussed and the process for developing such measures was shown by describing the process used to develop the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form.

PY  - 2010
AB  - Background: The perception of improvement by a patient has assumed a central role in functional evaluation after a variety of knee problems. One of the instruments most used in clinical research is the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form because its psychometric properties are considered to be excellent. Nonetheless, this questionnaire was originally developed for use in the English language. Therefore, to use this questionnaire in the Brazilian population, it is essential to translate and validate it.Purpose: The aim of this study was to translate the IKDC Subjective Knee Form into a Brazilian version and to test its validity and reproducibility.Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.Methods: The translation of the original IKDC Subjective Knee Form into a Brazilian version was accomplished in accordance with the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine guidelines and was tested in 32 patients with knee pathologic conditions to develop the ...

TI  - Surgical Approach to Articular Cartilage Repair
PY  - 2020
AB  - This chapter provides a comprehensive approach to evaluating patients with articular cartilage defects, as well as a description of treatment algorithms and surgical techniques. During the initial workup (history, physical exam, imaging), a thorough lower extremity assessment is emphasized such that comorbidities including ligamentous instability, malalignment, and meniscal deficiency can be concomitantly addressed. Patient and defect-specific factors pertinent to surgical decision-making are discussed along with an evidence-based and technical overview of common surgical approaches including microfracture, osteochondral (OC) autograft/allograft, and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). An approach to patients with a failed index cartilage procedure is also described.

TI  - Knee instability scores for ACL reconstruction
PY  - 2016
AB  - Despite abundant biological, biomechanical, and clinical research, return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury remains a significant challenge. Residual rotatory knee laxity has been identified as one of the factors responsible for poor functional outcome. To improve and standardize the assessment of knee instability, a variety of instability scoring systems is available. Recently, devices to objectively quantify static and dynamic clinical exams have been developed to complement traditional subjective grading systems. These devices enable an improved evaluation of knee instability and possible associated injuries. This additional information may promote the development of new treatment algorithms and allow for individualized treatment. In this review, the different subjective laxity scores as well as complementary objective measuring systems are discussed, along with an introduction of injury to an individualized treatment algorithm.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="Objective" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To investigate whether different degrees of primary varus knee affect joint function and stability in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A clinical data of 160 patients with primary varus knee, who were admitted between January 2020 and December 2021 and met the selection criteria, was retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent primary ACL reconstruction using autologous single-bundle hamstring tendon. Patients were divided into three groups based on the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA): group A (64 patients with HKA 0°-3°), group B (55 patients with HKA 3°-6°), and group C (41 patients with HKA 6°-9°). Except for the significant difference in HKA among the three groups ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05), baseline data such as age, gender, affected side, body mass index, interval between injury and operation, Kellgren-Lawrence grading, posterior tibial slope, proportion of combined meniscal injuries, Tegner score, Lysholm score, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) objective score, anterior drawer test, Lachman test, pivot shift test, and the results of KT1000 (side-to-side difference, SSD) showed no significant difference ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). At last follow-up, joint stability was assessed through the anterior drawer test, Lachman test, pivot shift test, and SSD; joint function was evaluated using the Tegner score, Lysholm score, and IKDC objective score.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">All incisions in the three groups healed by first intention after operation. All patients were followed up 24-31 months, with an average of 26 months; there was no significant difference in the follow-up time among the three groups ( <i>Z</i>=0.675, <i>P</i>=0.714). At last follow-up, the knee stability and functional assessment indicators in each group significantly improved when compared to preoperative ones ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05); there was no significant difference among the three groups ( <i>P</i>&gt;0.05) in terms of the anterior drawer test, Lachman test, pivot shift test, IKDC objective scores, and the changes of the Lysholm scores and Tegner scores. The Kellgren-Lawrence grading and HKA at last follow-up were consistent with preoperative results in the three groups.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Varying degrees of primary varus knee do not affect early knee joint stability and functional recovery after ACL reconstruction, and there is no significant difference in effectiveness between different degrees of varus knee.</AbstractText>

TI  - Current concepts in anatomic single- and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2011
AB  - An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is one of the most common orthopedic sport injuries. The ACL consists of 2 functional bundles-the anteromedial and posterolateral-which are named for the position of their insertion sites on the tibia. Anatomic ACL reconstruction can be defined as the restoration of the ACL to its native dimensions, collagen orientation, and insertion sites. Some biomechanical studies have demonstrated that anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore knee motion significantly similar to that of the normal knee, as compared with traditional, nonanatomic single-bundle procedures. In vivo kinematic studies have also shown that nonanatomic single-bundle reconstruction fails to restore normal dynamic knee stability in all cases. Accurate restoration of knee kinematics with anatomic ACL reconstruction is critical to protect against the possibility that nonatomic surgical technique could result in early osteoarthritis, which is common in patients who sustain ACL tears. Surgical techniques for ACL reconstruction vary, and if different aspects of the surgery are compared for superiority (eg, single- vs double-bundle techniques), it is necessary that both procedures meet criteria to be designated as "anatomic." By emphasizing the importance of restoring the native anatomy of the knee, surgeons can give their patients the best chance at restoration of joint function and preservation of long-term knee health.

TI  - Knee laxity modifications after ACL rupture and surgical intra- and extra-articular reconstructions: intra-operative measures in reconstructed and healthy knees
PY  - 2015
AB  - Quantifying the effects of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency on knee joint laxity is fundamental for understanding the outcomes of its reconstruction techniques. The general aim of this study was to determine intra-operatively the main modifications in knee laxity before and after standard isolated intra-articular and additional extra-articular anterolateral reinforcement. Our main hypothesis was that laxity abnormalities, particularly axial rotation, can still result from these ACL reconstruction techniques. Thirty-two patients with primary ACL deficiency were analysed by a navigation system immediately before and after each of the two reconstructions. Laxity measurements in terms of knee translations and rotations were taken during the anteroposterior drawer test, with internal–external rotation at 20° and 90° of flexion, and varus–valgus and pivot-shift tests. All these laxity measures were also taken originally from the contralateral healthy knee. With respect to the contralateral healthy knee, in the ACL-deficient knee significantly increased laxity (expressed in %) was found in the medial compared with that of the lateral compartment, respectively, 115 and 68 % in the drawer test at 20° flexion, and 55 and 46 % at 90° flexion. In the medial compartment, a significant 35 % increment was also observed for the coupled tibial anteroposterior translation during axial knee rotation at 20° of flexion. After isolated intra-articular reconstruction, normal values of anteroposterior laxity were found restored in the pivot-shift and drawer tests in the lateral compartment, but not fully in the medial compartment. After the reinforcement, laxity in the medial compartment was also found restored in the axial rotation test at 20° flexion. In ACL reconstruction, with respect to the contralateral knee, intra-articular plus additional anterolateral reinforcement procedures do not restore normal joint laxity. This combined procedure over-constrained the lateral compartment, while excessive laxity still persists at the medial one. III.

TI  - Five-Strand Hamstring Autograft Versus Quadruple Hamstring Autograft With Graft Diameters 8.0 Millimeters or More in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Clinical Outcomes With a Minimum 2-Year Follow-Up.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Purpose To compare the outcomes of 2 groups of patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction: the first with a quadrupled semitendinosus gracilis (ST-G) autograft larger than 8 mm diameter and the second with a 5-strand ST-G autograft larger than 8 mm due to an insufficient diameter graft harvesting. Methods This was a retrospective study with 70 patients divided into 2 groups. Inclusion criteria included ACL ruptures of less than 3 months, ST-G ACL reconstructions, and final (4-strand or 5-strand) graft size larger than 8 mm. Exclusion criteria included multiligament knee injuries, meniscal or chondral pathology, ACL re-ruptures, inflammatory joint disease, or other procedures in the knee. Results Group A comprised 33 patients with a quadruple ST-G graft, and group B comprised 37 patients with an insufficient graft diameter ( P  = .78). Average follow-up in group A was 32.2 (range 24-48) months and in group B was 30.35 (range 24-48) months ( P  = .75). Average graft diameter in group A was 8.5 mm (range 8-10) and in group B when the graft was measured as quadruple was 7.2 mm (range 6.5-7.5) and 9.2 mm (range 8-10) when it was converted to 5-strand ( P  = .00596). Group A had 3 (9%) re-ruptures, and group B had 2 (5.4%) ( P  = .55). The average postoperative Lysholm score in group A was 93.3 (range 71-100) and in group B was 97.1 (range 80-100) ( P  = .79). Mean postoperative International Knee Documentation Committee in group A was 91 (range 75.9-100) and in group B was 96.8 (range 82-100) ( P  = .18). Conclusions In our study, the 5-strand hamstring autograft in ACL reconstruction was clinically comparable with the quadruple autograft larger than 8 mm. The differences in re-rupture and clinical outcomes were not statistically significant between the 2 groups, suggesting that it is a valid option when we have a graft of insufficient diameter. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative study.

TI  - CORRELATIONS BETWEEN HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSES AND FUNCTIONAL EVALUATION OF THE KNEES OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ACL
PY  - 2007
AB  - Objective: This study investigated the relationship between range of motion and the histological analysis of the synovium of the knee joint following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Method: Histological, pain and range-of-motion (ROM) evaluations were performed on the knees of 26 patients. The Shapiro-Wilk test, Friedman test and Spearman correlation coefficient were utilized for verifying the existence of significant correlations between the variables, using the SPSS for Windows 12.0 statistical software with a significance level of 5%. Results: Comparing before and after the operation, statistical differences were found in relation to knee extension ROM (p= 0.042), flexion ROM (p= 0.001) and hyperextension (p= 0.001). There were also significant correlations between the subsynovial tissue and the flexion ROM of the operated knees (r= 0.53; p= 0.008), between the subsynovial tissue and the sensation of pain (r= 0.46; p= 0.024), and between the extension ROM after the operation and type I collagen (r= 0.52; p= 0.016). Conclusion: The greater the quantity of type I collagen observed, the thicker was the subsynovial tissue, the greater the reported pain, and the less was the ROM of the operated knees.

TI  - Reconstruction Considerations Following Complete Excision of Mucoid-Degenerated Anterior Cruciate Ligament: A Retrospective Study.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Mucoid degeneration (MD) of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is an unusual cause of knee pain and restricted movement, predominantly affecting the middle-aged population. Arthroscopic partial or total debridement of the mucoid ACL is the surgical treatment of choice. However, little is discussed in the literature regarding subsequent knee instability and functional outcomes following complete ACL excision.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A retrospective study was conducted on patients who underwent arthroscopic total ACL excision for mucoid ACL. Pre- and post-operatively, the Tegner-Lysholm score, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, and subjective functional instability were used to grade the clinical outcomes.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Ten out of the 13 patients who underwent complete ACL excision were available for evaluation. All patients presented with knee pain on deep flexion or extension with a painfully limited range of motion. Post-operatively, all patients were relieved of their original pain and dysfunction. The mean post-operative IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores were 74.96 and 83.6, respectively. All patients had a Lachman test positive, while only two had a grade 1 pivot shift test positive. Two patients had occasional functional instability only after strenuous exercises. None of the patients underwent subsequent ACL reconstruction.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">All patients reported improved functional outcomes. Only two out of 10 reported occasional instability during strenuous activity. Therefore, complete debridement of mucoid ACL in sedentary patients is safe and efficacious. However, active young patients may experience instability and require ACL reconstruction if it hinders their daily activities.</AbstractText>

TI  - ACL reconstruction with physiological graft tension by intraoperative adjustment of the anteroposterior translation to the uninjured contralateral knee
PY  - 2013
AB  - Fixation of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) substitutes with non-physiological anteroposterior translation (APT) worsens outcome. The aim was to present a technique for physiological APT adjustment of the transplant in ACL reconstruction and its outcome at midterm. In a consecutive series of 28 patients (age 32 ± 11 years, 24 male), chronic ACL deficiency was treated by bone-patella-tendon-bone reconstruction. Transplant APT was adjusted to that of the contralateral uninjured ACL, measured 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively using the Rolimeter®. At a median follow-up of 5.3 years (3–8years), 82 % of the patients were re-evaluated with APT measurement and using IKDC-, Tegner-, Lysholm-Scores, conventional radiographs and MRI. No differences in APT (mean ± SD) between uninjured and reconstructed knees were observed after adjustment (6 ± 1 versus 6 ± 1 mm, n.s.). Three months postoperatively, a statistically significant increase in APT (7 ± 1 mm) and a further increase at midterm (9 ± 2 mm) were observed. Patients scored “normal” or “nearly normal”, respectively, in 79 % (IKDC) and 4 (3–9) points (Tegner; median, range) or 89 ± 9 points (Lysholm; mean ± SD). Radiological evaluation showed no, minimal or moderate joint degeneration in 5, 20 and 75 % of patients, respectively. MRI confirmed intact ACL transplants in all patients. ACL reconstruction using the presented technique was considered successful, as patients did not suffer from subjective instability, radiographic analysis did not provide evidence for graft rupture at midterm. However, APT increase and occurrence of degenerative changes in reconstructed knees at the midterm might not be prevented even by restoration of a physiological APT in ACL reconstruction. The Rolimeter can be used for quick and easy intraoperative indirect control of the applied tension to the ACL transplant by measuring the APT to obtain physiological tensioning resulting in a satisfying outcome at midterm.

TI  - Evolução funcional da reparação do menisco por implante absorvível
PY  - 2009
AB  - OBJETIVO: Avaliar a evolucao funcional dos joelhos submetidos a reparacao da ruptura longitudinal do menisco com o implante absorvivel flecha (arrow). METODOS: Entre junho de 1997 e fevereiro de 2001, 23 pacientes com idade media de 26 anos foram avaliados. O seguimento medio foi de quatro meses (45-96). Realizaram-se 19 reparacoes mediais e quatro laterais. Os pacientes foram avaliados no pre e no pos-operatorio quanto a funcao, de acordo com a escala de Lysholm e, no pos-operatorio, pelo IKDC. RESULTADOS: Para melhor compreensao, os 23 individuos tratados foram divididos em tres grupos. Vinte e um apresentaram lesao do ligamento cruzado anterior e 11 foram submetidos a reconstrucao ligamentar (grupo I), com resultados considerados satisfatorios. Dez dos 21 pacientes com lesao do LCA nao foram submetidos a reconstrucao ligamentar (grupo II), dos quais cinco evoluiram satisfatoriamente, sem necessidade de reconstrucao ligamentar, cinco, com queixa de instabilidade e foram submetidos a reconstrucao ligamentar. Quatro desses pacientes apresentaram o menisco integro e uma ruptura do menisco medial. Dois apresentaram LCA intacto (grupo III), um evoluiu satisfatoriamente e outro apresentou ruptura do menisco lateral. De acordo com a escala de Lysholm, a media pre-operatoria foi de 57,53 e a media pos-operatoria, de 86,95, representando melhora estatisticamente significativa (Wilcoxon p < 0,01). Foi utilizada a ANOVA nao parametrica para dados ordinais com medidas repetidas para avaliar as medidas no pre e pos-operatorio, considerando os grupos I e II. Avaliou-se a estabilizacao do joelho e nao se detectou diferenca estatisticamente significativa entre os grupos I e II (p = 0,648). Mesmo supondo que houvesse diferenca entre os dois grupos, ambos tiveram o mesmo comportamento. Na avaliacao pos-operatoria pelo IKDC, quatro pacientes foram classificados como A; 13, como B; e 6, como C. Dos seis pacientes com resultados C, apenas dois apresentaram ruptura do menisco. CONCLUSAO: Dos 23 pacientes, apenas dois apresentaram falha da cicatrizacao dos meniscos reparados. De acordo com a escala de Lysholm, houve melhora significativa dos pacientes tratados. A reparacao do LCA nao influenciou os resultados.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament—Deficient Potential Copers and Noncopers Reveal Different Isokinetic Quadriceps Strength Profiles in the Early Stage after Injury:
PY  - 2010
AB  - BackgroundIsokinetic muscle strength testing using the peak torque value is the most frequently included quadriceps muscle strength measurement for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)—injured subjects.Purpose and HypothesesThe purpose of this study was to investigate quadriceps muscle performance during the whole isokinetic curve in subjects with ACL deficiency classified as potential copers or noncopers and to investigate whether these curve profiles were associated with single-legged hop performance. We hypothesized that quadriceps muscle torque at other knee flexion angles than peak torque would give more information about quadriceps muscle strength deficits. Furthermore, we hypothesized that there would be significant torque differences between potential copers and noncopers and a significant relationship between angle-specific torque values and single-legged hop performance.Study DesignCross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.MethodsSeventy-six individuals with a complete unilateral ACL rupture withi...

TI  - Ipsi- or contralateral patellar tendon graft in anterior cruciate ligament revision surgery. A comparison of two methods.
PY  - 1998
AB  - Twenty-four patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament revision surgery were studied postoperatively (12 with reharvested ipsilateral patellar tendon grafts and 12 with contralateral patellar tendon grafts). For comparison purposes, 12 matched patients with primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, who had been operated on using the same technique by the same surgeons, were chosen. The median time since the first reconstruction was 57 months (range, 15 to 132) in the ipsilateral tendon group and 54 months (range, 20 to 108) in the contralateral tendon group. Follow-up examination showed that there were no significant differences in total KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side measurements between the groups, but the Lysholm score was higher for patients with contralateral tendon grafts than for patients with ipsilateral grafts. Only two patients with ipsilateral grafts were classified as having excellent or good results. Functional testing outcomes were similar for all groups, and magnetic resonance imaging screening showed no differences between the reharvest and primary harvest groups in terms of length, width, thickness, or donor site gap of the patellar tendon. However, there were two major complications in the group with revision surgery with the ipsilateral reharvested patellar tendon. Reharvesting the ipsilateral patellar tendon resulted in lower functional scores and a higher rate of complications than revision with the contralateral patellar tendon or primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

TI  - Influence of Anticipation and Motor-Motor Task Performance on Cutting Biomechanics in Healthy Men.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Context Biomechanical analyses of cutting tasks have demonstrated kinematic differences associated with the noncontact knee-injury risk when the movement direction is unanticipated. Motor-motor dual tasks occur within dynamic environments and change the demand for attentional resources needed to complete athletic maneuvers, which may contribute to injury risk. Objective To investigate the influence of anticipation and motor-motor task performance on cutting biomechanics. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Laboratory. Patients or other participants A total of 32 healthy, recreationally active men (age = 23.1 ± 3.6 years, height = 180.0 ± 7.0 cm, mass = 81.3 ± 17.3 kg) who self-reported regular participation in cutting sports. Intervention(s) Participants performed a 45° side-step cut on the dominant limb in a random order of conditions: anticipation (anticipated, unanticipated) and task (no ball throw, ball fake, ball throw). Main outcome measure(s) Triplanar trunk, hip, and knee angles were assessed throughout the stance phase using 3-dimensional motion capture. Data were analyzed using a time series of means calculated from initial contact to toe-off (0%-100%) with 90% confidence intervals. Mean differences between conditions were identified as regions of nonoverlapping confidence intervals, and those that occurred during the region of peak vertical ground reaction force (0%-25%) are presented. Results Regardless of anticipation, attending to a ball (ball throw) resulted in more trunk extension (range = 2.9°-3.7°) and less lateral trunk flexion toward the cutting direction (range = 5.2°-5.9°). Planning to attend to a ball (ball fake) resulted in less lateral trunk flexion toward the cutting direction (4.7°). During unanticipated cutting, more trunk rotation away from the cutting direction was observed when attending to a ball (range = 5.3°-7.1°). The interaction of anticipation and task had a similar influence on sagittal- and frontal-plane trunk position. Conclusions Motor-motor task performance and its interaction with anticipation induced an upright, neutral trunk position during side-step cutting, which has been associated with the risk for noncontact knee injury. Promoting task complexity during rehabilitation and injury-prevention programs may better prepare individuals to succeed when performing high-risk athletic maneuvers.

TI  - Effect of physiotherapy attendance on outcome after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a pilot study
PY  - 2004
AB  - Background: In many centres patients are routinely referred for physiotherapy after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. However, to date the role and amount of supervised physiotherapy required has not been clearly established. Objective: To establish whether there was any difference in outcome between a group of patients who attended physiotherapy regularly after ACL reconstruction and a group who attended only infrequently. Methods: Ten patients who had attended physiotherapy infrequently (mean 1.9 visits) during the first six months after ACL reconstructive surgery were matched for age, sex, graft type, and activity level and occupation before injury with 10 patients who had attended physiotherapy regularly (mean 26.5 visits). Outcome was assessed at 12 months using the Cincinnati knee rating system and the IKDC form. Results: Compared with the regular physiotherapy group, patients in the minimal physiotherapy group had fewer symptoms (mean Cincinnati symptom score 46.2 v 43.4, p  =  0.045). There was also a trend towards higher overall Cincinnati knee scores in the minimal physiotherapy group (mean 93.7 v 87.3, p  =  0.06) but no difference in IKDC ratings. Conclusion: These preliminary results indicate that some patients who choose to attend physiotherapy on a very limited basis after ACL reconstruction can achieve satisfactory, if not better, outcomes than patients who attend physiotherapy regularly.

TI  - Comparison of Return to Pre-Injury Sport After 10 mm Size Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone (BPTB) versus 8 mm Hamstring Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Retrospective Study with a Two-Year Follow-Up.
PY  - 2018
AB  - BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the reconstruction of a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) with 10 mm diameter BPTB (bone-patellar tendon-bone) autograft versus 8 mm HT (hamstring tendon) autografts, to compare the ability to restore pre-injury sports activities and reduce revision risk after these procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective clinical review was performed to compare results of patients who underwent primary anatomical ACLR with 10 mm BPTB autografts with patients who underwent 8 mm diameter HT autografts, between January 2011 and January 2014. RESULTS There were 183 patients evaluated: the 8 mm HT group showed statistically significant higher knee laxity values compared to the 10 mm BPTB group (p=0.042), and significant difference were detected in subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation scores; the average subjective IKDC evaluations after two-year follow-up in the HT group was 88.45±2.8 versus 89.24±2.5 in BPTB group (p=0.047). In the evaluation of the IKDC objective protocol, results were excellent and good in 83 patients (94.3%) after BPTB and in 78 patients (82%) after HT ACLR (p<0.05). The average score on the Tegner activity scale in the HT group decreased from 6.5 at pre-injury to 5.8 at two-year follow-up (p<0.001) and from 6.7 at pre-injury to 6.5 at two-year follow-up in the BPTB group (p=0.4). The ability to restore pre-injury sports activities was higher in the BPTB group (6.5) versus the HT group (5.8) (p<0.001). Revision was required for two patients (2.2%) in the BPTB group compared with 14 patients (14.7%) in the HT group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Smaller HT graft size was a predictor of higher knee laxity and greater revision risk at two-year post primary ACL reconstruction. Larger diameter BPTB ACL grafts had a better ability to restore knee stability and greater ability to restore pre-injury sports activities.

TI  - Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic analysis of knee rotational stability in ACL-deficient patients during walking, running and pivoting
PY  - 2016
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency leads to altered stability of the knee. The purpose of this study was to compare the dynamic, rotational stability of the knee, expressed as rotational stiffness, between anterior cruciate ligament-deficient (ACLD) knees, their contralateral intact knees (ACLI) and a knee healthy control group during walking, running and 90° pivoting. We hypothesized a larger tibial internal rotation, a smaller knee joint external moment and a lower rotational stiffness in the ACLD group compared to the ACLI and the control group. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected from both legs of 44 ACLD patients and 16 healthy controls during walking, running and a pivoting maneuver (descending a staircase and immediately pivoting 90° on the landing leg). Motion data were captured using 8 high-speed cameras and a force-plate. Reflective markers were attached to bony landmarks of the lower limb and rigid clusters on the shank and thigh (CASH model). Maximum internal tibial rotation and the corresponding rotational moment were identified for all tasks and groups and used to calculate rotational stiffness (= Δmoment /Δrotation) of the knee. The tibial internal rotation of the ACLD knee was not significantly different from the ACLI knee during all three tasks. During walking and running, the tibial rotation of the control group was significantly different from both legs of the ACL-injured patient. For pivoting, no difference in tibial rotation between knees of the ACLD, ACLI and the control group was found. Knee joint external moments were not significantly different between the three groups during walking and pivoting. During running, the moments of the ACLI group were significantly higher than both the knees of the ACLD and the control group. Rotational stiffness did not differ significantly between groups in any of the three tasks. A high-intensity activity combining stair descent and pivoting produces similar angular rotations, knee joint external moments and rotational stiffness in ACLD knees compared to ACLI knees and the control group. During running, the ACLI knee displayed a higher external moment than the ACLD and the healthy control group. This could indicate some type of protective strategy or muscular adaptation in the ACL-injured patients.

TI  - Increased Magnetic Resonance Imaging Signal of the Lateral Patellar Facet Cartilage: A Functional Marker for Patellar Instability?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background:In the knee joint, predisposition for patellar instability can be assessed by an abnormal Insall-Salvati index, tibial tuberosity–trochlear groove (TTTG) distance, and abnormal shape of patella and trochlea. Given the complex anatomic features of the knee joint with varying positions of the patella during motion, the presence of a single or even a combination of these factors does not inevitably result in patellar instability. After trocheoplasty in patients with trochlear dysplasia, assessment of trochlear cartilage and subchondral bone is limited due to postoperative artifacts. Identification of presence of edema in the patellar cartilage may be helpful to identify patellar instability before and after surgery in these patients.Purpose:To determine whether increased signal intensity of the lateral patellar facet cartilage or measurements of abnormal patellofemoral articulation are associated with patellar instability before and after trochleoplasty.Study Design:Case series; Level of evidence,...

AB  - The aim was to assess the results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction regarding graft failure, knee laxity, and osteoarthritis (OA) from a longterm perspective. It was hypothesized that intact ACL graft reduces the risk for increased OA development. The cohort comprised 60 patients with a median follow-up 31 (range 28–33) years after ACL reconstruction. They were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging, radiography, KT-1000 arthrometer and the pivot shift test. Out of the 60 patients, 30 (50%) showed an intact ACL graft and 30 (50%) a ruptured or absent ACL graft. Patients with ruptured ACL grafts had more medial tibiofemoral compartment OA than those with an intact ACL graft (p = 0.0003). OA was asymmetric in patients with ruptured ACL grafts with more OA in the medial than in the lateral tibiofemoral compartment (p = 0.013) and the patellofemoral compartment (p = 0.002). The distribution of OA between compartments was similar in patients with an intact ACL graft. KT-1000 values of anterior knee laxity were higher in patients with ruptured compared to those with intact ACL grafts (p = 0.012). Side-to-side comparisons of anterior knee laxity showed higher KT-1000 values in patients with ruptured ACL graft (p = 0.0003) and similar results in those with intact graft (p = 0.09). The pivot shift grade was higher in the group with a ruptured ACL graft (p < 0.0001). Median 31 (range 28–33) years after ACL reconstruction, 50% of the patients showed an intact ACL graft and no side-to-side difference regarding anterior knee laxity. Patients with ruptured ACL grafts had more OA of the medial tibiofemoral compartment than those with intact ACL grafts. Retrospective cohort study, Level III.

TI  - Arthroscopic reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament by using a quadriceps tendon autograft: a minimum 5-year follow-up.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Purpose: We prospectively assessed 22 consecutively treated patients to determine the effectiveness and safety of arthroscopically assisted posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction by using a quadriceps tendon autograft. Methods: Twenty-two patients with isolated PCL injury who underwent PCL reconstruction with a quadriceps tendon autograft were enrolled in the prospective study. The average follow-up period was 66 months (range, 60-76). Follow-up included Lysholm knee scores, Tegner activity scores, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, thigh muscle assessment, and radiographic assessment. Results: The mean preoperative Lysholm score for 22 knees was 67 (range, 50 to 75), and the mean postoperative Lysholm score was 89 (range, 75 to 98). Nineteen of 22 patients (86%) displayed good or excellent results in the final assessment. The mean preoperative Tegner score for 22 knees was 3 (range, 2 to 5), whereas the mean postoperative Tegner score was 6 (range, 3 to 9). There were statistically significant improvements in Lysholm score ( P = .009), Tegner score ( P = .039), postoperative KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) scores ( P = .006), final IKDC rating ( P = .035), and thigh atrophy and muscle strength ( P Conclusions: After follow-up for more than 60 months, the analytical results showed patients achieved satisfactory function after PCL reconstruction by using a quadriceps tendon–patellar bone autograft. This study suggests that a quadriceps tendon autograft is sufficiently large and strong and can achieve good ligament function after reconstruction. Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic study.

TI  - Increased Femoral Anteversion Influence Over Surgically Treated Recurrent Patellar Instability Patients
PY  - 2016
AB  - Purpose To verify the influence that increased femoral anteversion (FA) has on patients with recurrent patellar instability (RPI) treated by anteromedialization tibial tubercle osteotomy (TTO) combined with medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLR) and to present the midterm outcomes of these patients. Methods From January 2008 to August 2013, skeletally mature patients with RPI and tibial tubercle (TT)–trochlear groove (TG) ≥ 17 mm who underwent anteromedialization TTO combined with MPFLR were evaluated for J sign, patellar glide, apprehension test, increased FA, Caton index, trochlea dysplasia, TT-TG, Kujala, International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee evaluation form, and Tegner. Increased FA was determined clinically by a difference of more than 30° between hip internal and external rotation, 70° or more of hip internal rotation, and 30° or more of femoral neck anteversion. A subgroup analysis involving increased FA was made. Results Forty-eight patients composed the study group. Mean follow-up was 41.5 ± 11.05 months. The J-sign was present in 86% before surgery and none postoperatively ( P P P  = .004). Trochlea dysplasia was present in all patients. TT-TG preoperatively was 20.77 ± 2.12 mm and 11.33 ± 1.24 mm postoperatively ( P P P  = .01). Increased FA group had worse Kujala compared with the normal FA group and worse Kujala improvement: 77.7 and 85.89 ( P  = .012), and 21.7 and 26.1, respectively ( P Conclusions Increased FA in patients with RPI had a negative effect on the outcome of anteromedialization TTO combined with MPFLR. Combined anteromedialization TTO and MPFLR had good functional midterm outcomes in treating patients with RPI and TT-TG ≥ 17 mm. Level of Evidence Level III, comparative study.

TI  - An Unusual Epidemic of Staphylococcus-Negative Infections Involving Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Salvage of the Graft and Function
PY  - 2000
AB  - We performed a retrospective study of 13 patients who had postoperative clinical and laboratory signs of infection after autogenous bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions. From January 1991 to November 1996 we experienced only 2 infected knees in 1,300 reconstructions, but between December 1996 and February 1997 10 patients in 70 ACL reconstructions developed a postoperative suspected infection. We found the origin of contamination (coagulase-negative Staphylococcus) in the supposedly sterile inflow cannula. When we changed this device, we had only 1 infection in the next 400 reconstructions. The diagnosis in these cases was derived from clinical signs and laboratory results, but only 2 of 11 samples of aspirated synovial fluid tested positive for Staphylococcus. The mean interval between the surgery and the onset of signs of infection and the start of antibiotic therapy was 7.7 days. All the patients had antibiotic association at the highest level. Six knees underwent arthroscopic debridement when the clinical signs indicated resistence to antibiotics. The normal postoperative rehabilitation program was modified but was not discontinued. Although recovery time was longer, overall results were similar to uncomplicated reconstructions. On the basis of our experience, we believe that when there is a notable increase in infection rates, a thorough search for contamination is indicated. Our source of infection was material that was thought to be sterile. Ultimately, early diagnosis and treatment is of critical importance to obtain good results. Even suspicion of infective postoperative complication should be sufficient cause to search for responsible microorganisms and begin antibiotic therapy. Arthroscopic debridement should be proposed to patients with resistence to antibiotics.

TI  - Third-Generation Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (Cells Cultured Within Collagen Membrane) Is Superior to Microfracture for Focal Chondral Defects of the Knee Joint: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">To systematically review randomized controlled trials to compare clinical outcomes of microfracture (MFx) versus third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) for the treatment of focal chondral defects (FCDs) of the knee joint.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE to locate randomized controlled trials comparing minimum 2-year clinical outcomes of patients undergoing MFx versus third-generation ACI for FCDs of the knee joint. The search terms used were: "knee" AND "microfracture" AND "autologous chondrocyte" AND "randomized." Patients were evaluated based on treatment failure rates, magnetic resonance imaging, International Cartilage Repair Society scores, and patient-reported outcome scores (Lysholm, Tegner, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, modified Cincinnati Knee Rating System, 12-item Short Form Health Survey Physical and Mental, and the EuroQol 5 Dimensions Visual Analog Scale score).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Six studies (5 Level I, 1 Level II) met inclusion criteria, including a total of 238 patients undergoing MFx and 274 undergoing ACI. Two studies had an overlapping cohort of patients and therefore the study with longer follow-up was used in all analyses. The average follow-up among patients ranged from 2.0 years to 6.0 years. Average lesion size ranged from 1.8 cm<sup>2</sup> to 5.0 cm<sup>2</sup>. Treatment failure ranged from 0% to 1.8% in the ACI group and 2.5% to 8.3% in the MFx group. In 4 studies, ACI patients demonstrated significantly greater improvement in multiple Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscores compared with MFx. In 2 studies, patients who received ACI demonstrated significantly greater improvement in the Tegner score compared to MFx, and 1 study showed significantly greater improvement in the Lysholm and ICRS scores for ACI compared with MFx.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">At short-term follow-up, third-generation ACI demonstrates a lower failure rate and greater improvement in patient-reported outcomes compared with MFx for FCDs of the knee joint.</AbstractText>

TI  - Anterior cruciate ligament repair with internal brace augmentation: A systematic review.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Primary repair of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures has re-emerged as a treatment option for proximal tears, with internal brace augmentation often utilised. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the current evidence presenting outcomes of ACL repair with internal bracing to assess the safety and efficacy of this technique.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">All studies reporting outcomes of arthroscopic primary repair of proximal ACL tears, augmented with internal bracing from 2014-2021 were included. Primary outcome was failure rate and secondary outcomes were subjective patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and objective assessment of anteroposterior knee laxity.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Nine studies were included, consisting of 347 patients, mean age 32.5 years, mean minimum follow up 2 years. There were 36 failures (10.4%, CI 7.4% - 14.1%). PROMs reporting was variable across studies. KOOS, Lysholm and IKDC scores were most frequently used with mean scores &gt; 87%. The mean Tegner and Marx scores at follow-up were 6.1 and 7.8 respectively. The mean side to side difference measured for anteroposterior knee laxity was 1.2mm.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">This systematic review with meta-analysis shows that ACL repair with internal bracing is a safe technique for treatment of proximal ruptures, with a failure rate of 10.4%. Subjective scores and clinical laxity testing also revealed satisfactory results. This suggests that ACL repair with internal bracing should be considered as an alternative to ACL reconstruction for acute proximal tears, with the potential benefits of retained native tissue and proprioception, as well as negating the need for graft harvest.</AbstractText>

TI  - A Progressive 5-Week Exercise Therapy Program Leads to Significant Improvement in Knee Function Early After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury
PY  - 2010
AB  - Study Design Prospective cohort study without a control group. Objectives Firstly, to present our 5-week progressive exercise therapy program in the early stage after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Secondly, to evaluate changes in knee function after completion of the program for patients with ACL injury in general and also when classified as potential copers or noncopers, and, finally, to examine potential adverse events. Background Few studies concerning early-stage ACL rehabilitation protocols exist. Consequently, little is known about the tolerance for, and outcomes from, short-term exercise therapy programs in the early stage after injury. Methods One-hundred patients were included in a 5-week progressive exercise therapy program, within 3 months after injury. Knee function before and after completion of the program was evaluated from isokinetic quadriceps and hamstrings muscle strength tests, 4 single-leg hop tests, 2 different self-assessment questionnaires, and a global rating of knee fu...

TI  - Reconstruction of Symptomatic Congenital Anterior Cruciate Ligament Insufficiency.
PY  - 2019
AB  - BACKGROUND Hypoplasia or congenital absence of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a rare disorder occurring in ∼1 in every 6000 births. Although some patients with hypoplasia or agenesis of the ACL may not complain of instability, others desire to participate in more demanding activities that require the stability of a competent ACL. There are limited reports of surgical treatment of this patient population. The purpose of this study was to report ACL reconstruction in a case series of patients with symptomatic congenital ACL deficiency. METHODS A retrospective medical record review of the surgical treatment of 14 knees (13 patients) with congenital absence of the ACL at a tertiary care institution from 1995 to 2012 was performed. Patients with a minimum of 1 year of clinical follow-up were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS The mean age at time of surgery was 12.6 (range, 3 to 22), including 6 patients <12 years of age. Mean follow-up was 2.9 years (range, 1 to 6.6). Nine of 13 patients (69%) had underlying congenital abnormalities/associated syndromes. Preoperative Lachman and pivot shift examination was International Knee Documentation Committee grade C or D in all but 1 knee. ACL reconstruction was performed with combined intra-articular/extra-articular physeal sparing reconstruction with iliotibial band (n=5), autograft hamstring (n=2) or bone-patellar tendon-bone (n=3), or allograft (n=4). Multiligament reconstruction of associated ligamentous deficiency was performed in 7 knees (50%). Postoperative Lachman and pivot shift testing was International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) grade A or B in all but 1 knee. One patient with congenital absence of multiple knee ligaments required revision ACL reconstruction surgery, with concurrent first-time posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, due to persistent instability. None required revision surgery due to graft tear at a minimum of 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Surgical stabilization of symptomatic congenital ACL insufficiency, with associated ligamentous reconstruction as required on a case-by-case basis, results in improved stability at early clinical follow-up, with low complication rates. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level IV-retrospective case series.

TI  - Current perspectives in stem cell research for knee cartilage repair
PY  - 2014
AB  - Protocols based on the delivery of stem cells are currently applied in patients, showing encouraging results for the treatment of articular cartilage lesions (focal defects, osteoarthritis). Yet, restoration of a fully functional cartilage surface (native structural organization and mechanical functions) especially in the knee joint has not been reported to date, showing the need for improved designs of clinical trials. Various sources of progenitor cells are now available, originating from adult tissues but also from embryonic or reprogrammed tissues, most of which have already been evaluated for their chondrogenic potential in culture and for their reparative properties in vivo upon implantation in relevant animal models of cartilage lesions. Nevertheless, particular attention will be needed regarding their safe clinical use and their potential to form a cartilaginous repair tissue of proper quality and functionality in the patient. Possible improvements may reside in the use of biological supplements in accordance with regulations, while some challenges remain in establishing standardized, effective procedures in the clinics.

TI  - In Vivo Three-Dimensional Imaging Analysis of Femoral and Tibial Tunnel Locations in Single and Double Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstructions
PY  - 2014
AB  - Anatomical anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft positioning is considered a key factor for proper postoperative knee function and restoration of the physiologic kinematics of the femorotibial joint in ACL reconstruction.1) Properly placed tibial and femoral tunnels are important because tunnel misplacement can cause graft impingement and changes in graft tension patterns, resulting in knee instability.2) Biomechanical tests on cadaveric reconstructions have demonstrated nearly normal knee kinematics when the tibial tunnel was located close to the center of the tibial footprint and the femoral tunnel was placed in the center of the femoral footprint of the ACL.2)

For decades, the reconstructive option for ACL deficiency has been single bundle (SB) reconstruction with 1 femoral and 1 tibial tunnel. With its simplified procedure, the transtibial tunnel drilling of femoral tunnels was the most widely performed reconstruction technique. However, it is known that the ACL consists of two different bundles, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles, and the double bundle (DB) technique, which aims at restoring the original anatomy of the ACL has also recently gained popularity. 3)

Evaluating the tunnel position using postoperative radiographs after ACL reconstruction is known to be difficult. 4) With the recent advancement of imaging tools and their related programs, three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) is known to provide good visualization of the bony structures with high accuracy.5) Measurement of the ACL tunnel location using 3D-CT has been shown to be reliable,6) and the locations of the tunnel positions of the SB and DB have previously been presented.7) The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare the femoral and tibial tunnel positions of transtibial SB and transportal DB ACL reconstruction using 3D-CT.

TI  - Management of unicompartmental arthritis in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee.
PY  - 2000
AB  - There exists a group of patients who are difficult to manage because they have both anterior knee instability secondary to anterior cruciate ligament deficiency and unilateral degenerative joint disease. A large majority of these patients report a history of previous meniscal injury or meniscectomy after knee trauma at a relatively young age. Active patients who report symptomatic knee instability or pain associated with athletics or activities of daily living after conservative treatment may be indicated for surgery. Current endoscopic methods of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction result in low patient morbidity, the elimination of anterior knee instability, and a timely return of function. Osteotomies about the knee joint are an effective means of treating unicompartmental knee arthrosis. Long-term studies have demonstrated that knee osteotomy is a good surgical option for patients with unicompartmental arthritis who are considered too young for total knee arthroplasty. We describe a comprehensive treatment approach to the patient with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency and isolated medial or lateral osteoarthritis. An assessment of pain symptoms, instability symptoms, and lower extremity alignment is used to formulate a treatment plan.

TI  - Changes in bone scans after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective study.
PY  - 2002
AB  - BackgroundWhether anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction retards the progression of osteoarthrosis is not established. Bone scintigraphy can be useful for monitoring the course of osteoarthrosis. Bone scan findings are abnormal in the majority of patients with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency. Three uptake patterns can be distinguished.HypothesisReconstruction corrects the three abnormal bone scan patterns seen in patients with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency.Study DesignProspective cohort study.MethodsWe performed bone scintigraphy in 80 patients, before and 2 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.ResultsReconstruction consistently corrected type 2 bone scan pattern (meniscus scan) but not type 1 and 3 patterns (osteoarthrosis and cartilage ulcer scan). Correction of all three patterns decreased among patients who had longer duration of anterior cruciate ligament deficiency and was more reliable for the combined uptake of all three patterns among patients who had less than 6...

TI  - Outcome of repaired unstable meniscal tears in children and adolescents
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background Unstable meniscal tears are rare injuries in skeletally immature patients. Loss of a meniscus increases the risk of subsequent development of degenerative changes in the knee. This study deals with the outcome of intraarticular meniscal repair and factors that affect healing. Parameters of interest were type and location of the tear and also the influence of simultaneous reconstruction of a ruptured ACL. Methods We investigated the outcome of 25 patients (29 menisci) aged 15 (4–17) years who underwent surgery for full thickness meniscal tears, either as isolated lesions or in combination with ACL ruptures. Intraoperative documentation followed the IKDC 2000 standard. Outcome measurements were the Tegner score (pre- and postoperatively) and the Lysholm score (postoperatively) after an average follow-up period of 2.3 years, with postoperative arthroscopy and MRT in some cases. Results 24 of the 29 meniscal lesions healed (defined as giving an asymptomatic patient) regardless of location or type. ...

TI  - Early or delayed anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Is one superior? A systematic review and meta-analysis
PY  - 2019
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a rapidly developing orthopaedic field and an area of notable clinical equipoise. The optimal timing of surgery in an acute (< 3 weeks) or delayed (≥ 3 weeks) time frame remains unresolved with a 2010 meta-analysis concluding no difference between these two groups across multiple outcomes. In an era of evidence-based medicine, surgeons are still basing their decisions on when to operate on little more than anecdotal evidence and personal preference. Clear guidance is required to determine whether the timing of surgery can optimise outcomes in this largely young and active patient cohort. A systematic literature search was performed in January 2018 of Embase, Medline and OpenGrey in accordance with (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 658 articles were retrieved, with 6 suitable for inclusion, covering 576 ACL reconstructions. Four meta-analyses were performed assessing subjective measures of Tegner activity scale and Lysholm score, and objective measures of arthroscopically identified meniscal and chondral injury. Additional relevant outcome measures underwent narrative review. Study bias was assessed and reported using the Downs and Black checklist. A statistically significant difference of 0.39 points was found on the Tegner activity scale in favour of early surgery within 3 weeks (RR 0.39, CI 0.10, 0.67, p = 0.008). No statistically difference was found between groups for the patient-reported Lysholm score (RR − 0.18, CI − 2.40, 2.05, p = 0.17). There was no statistically significant difference between groups for intra-operative findings of meniscal lesions (RR 0.84, CI 0.66, 1.08, p = 0.17). A trend towards significance was observed for the incidence of chondral lesions in the early surgery group (RR 0.56, CI 0.31, 1.02, p = 0.06). All the studies were rated either fair or good on the Downs and Black checklist with no study excluded due to bias. Although there was a statistically significant result for the Tegner activity scale in favour of early surgery, the magnitude of the effect is unlikely to translate into any clinically meaningful difference. At present, there remains no clear evidence to determine superiority of acute/early or delayed reconstruction of a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament. Further research through methodologically robust randomised controlled trials or through the UK National Ligament Registry  may help to provide clearer guidance.

TI  - Clinical and radiological outcome of extended lateral approach via epicondyle osteotomy in complex lateral tibia plateau fractures involving the central and postero-lateral segments.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of complex lateral tibial plateau fractures involving the central segments of the lateral tibial plateau. It was hypothesized that an extended lateral approach by using the lateral epicondyle osteotomy improves the rate of malreduction and yields to good and excellent clinical results at a mid-term follow-up.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This retrospective case series conducted at two centers evaluated complex lateral tibial plateau fractures treated with an extended lateral approach by lateral epicondyle osteotomy. Fractures were classified according to the AO/OTA and 10-segment classification, with only B/C type fractures involving the antero-latero-central (ALC) and postero-latero-central (PLC)/postero-latero-lateral (PLL) segments. Postoperative computer tomography scans were used to assess the quality of reduction. Clinical outcomes and postoperative complications were evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 2 years.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Sixty-five patients (mean age: 47.7 ± 11.5 years) were included, with an average follow-up of 51.9 ± 3.6 months. Radiological outcomes revealed a postoperative fracture step at the ALC/PLC crossing of 0.8 ± 1.1 mm, at the PLC/PLL crossing of 0.4 ± 1.1 mm, and a fracture gap of 1.8 ± 4.0 mm, yielding a Rasmussen Score of 15.1 ± 3.2. No significant differences among type B and C fractures were identified. No case of nonunion of the lateral epicondyle osteotomy was recorded. The mean Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score was 80.4 ± 16.2 (type B 85.6 ± 11.9 vs. type C 76.1 ± 18.4, p &lt; 0.05), Lysholm score was 83.4 ± 17.1 (B 89 ± 11.3 vs. C 78.7 ± 20.1, p &lt; 0.05) and International Knee Documentation Committee score was 69.9 ± 18.8 (type B 76.5 ± 15.7 vs. type C 64.3 ± 20.1, p &lt; 0.05). Early complication rate requiring surgical revision due to malreduction or infection were 7 %. None of the patients reported about subjective lateral knee instability at the time of clinical follow-up.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The extended lateral approach with lateral epicondyle osteotomy demonstrated excellent radiological alignment and favorable mid-term clinical outcomes. An overall low complication rate was recorded. Notably, long-term revisions due to lateral instability were absent, indicating the safety and efficacy of lateral epicondyle osteotomy as an operative technique.</AbstractText>

AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To assess the outcomes of medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction using synthetic suture tape in paediatric patients with patellofemoral instability (PFI).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This ambispective comparative study, conducted from 2014 to 2022, included paediatric patients who underwent MPFL reconstruction with synthetic suture tape and had a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Pre- and postoperative clinical and functional outcomes, patient satisfaction and complications were assessed.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The study comprised 22 patients (29 knees), with a median age at surgery of 14.4 years (interquartile range [IQR] 10.9-16.7) and a median follow-up of 46.5 months (24.7-66). Notably, 13 knees (44.8%) had open growth plates at the time of surgery. The cohort included patients with Down syndrome (3 patients), Ehlers-Danlos (2), arthrogryposis (1), generalized joint hypermobility (8) and previous unsuccessful PFI surgeries (8). Concomitant procedures were performed on 16 knees. Postoperatively, improvements were observed in all but one patient, who reported residual pain. There were two other complications: one suture-tape rupture and one surgical wound infection. Functional scores significantly improved: Kujala, +14 points (7-29) (p &lt; 0.001); IKDC, +10.5 points (5.2-25.3) (p &lt; 0.001); Tegner, +2 points (0-4) (p &lt; 0.001); Lysholm, +15 points (0-37.5) (p &lt; 0.001). Most patients achieved excellent outcomes by Crosby-Insall criteria (21 patients, 72.4%) and reported high satisfaction (23 patients, 79.3%).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">MPFL reconstruction using synthetic suture tape is a viable and effective treatment for paediatric patients with PFI, particularly for those with connective tissue disorders, generalized joint hypermobility or past surgical failures, significantly enhancing clinical and functional outcomes with an acceptable complication rate.</AbstractText>

TI  - Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Magnetic resonance imaging and factors influencing outcome
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Purpose This study was conducted to determine the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in cases of complications following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery, and to correlate these complications with their possible etiological factors based on clinical and radiological criteria. Methods The study included 48 symptomatic patients (40 males and 8 females) after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction in the period between 2006 and 2008. Clinical evaluation of the patients was performed using the International Knee Documentation Committee scoring system (IKDC). MRI was performed using 1.5 T dedicated system and a standard imaging protocol. The scans were then reviewed by two senior radiologists for the assessment of integrity of the reconstructed ligament and the presence of related complications. The findings were then analyzed and correlated with the clinical evaluation. Results Tunnel widening was the most common MRI finding seen, as it was present in 42 patients (87.5%). The detected post reconstructive complications encountered in our patients included graft tear in 34 patients (70.83%), impingement in 12 patients (25%), osteoarthritis in six patients (12.5%), cystic degeneration in two patients (4.16%), and Cyclops lesion in two patients (4.16%). Conclusions MRI is a valuable imaging modality for assessment of post ACL reconstructive complications, as it is useful in demonstrating tunnel positioning, graft integrity and other soft tissue structures of the knee. It also helps in identifying possible underlying causes and predisposing factors for ACL graft failure.

TI  - International Knee Documentation Committee Radiographic Knee Joint Grading More Reliable Than Kellgren-Lawrence Grading and Other Grading Systems.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Kellgren-Lawrence grading appears to have become the de facto standard for reporting radiographic degeneration of knees, yet the much later-introduced and knee-specific International Knee Documentation Committee system has repeatedly been shown to have higher reliability. Although International Knee Documentation Committee radiographic grading does have limitations-especially in cases of severe gonarthrosis-it appears to be the most reliable current system suitable for the purposes of arthroscopic knee surgeons, and it was designed to encompass all 3 knee compartments. Posterior-anterior weight-bearing radiographs taken at approximately 45° of knee flexion have repeatedly been shown to be more sensitive for revealing tibiofemoral degeneration than standard anterior-posterior weight-bearing views at or near full extension.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Background:Posterior tibial slope (PTS) has recently been identified as a risk factor for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries because of an associated increase in anterior tibial translation (ATT) and ACL loading. However, few studies concerning the correlation between PTS and postoperative ATT have been published.Purpose:To analyze the relationship between PTS and postoperative ATT in ACL reconstruction (ACLR).Study Design:Case control study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:Included in this retrospective study were 40 consecutive patients who underwent ACLR (28 male, 12 female; median age, 22 years; range, 14-44 years) from October 2010 to June 2011. The patients were divided into 3 groups based on medial and lateral PTS values as measured on MRI. Demographic data and results of the manual maximum side-to-side difference with a KT-1000 arthrometer at 30° of knee flexion before ACLR and at final follow-up were collected; results were divided into ATT ≤2 mm, 2 mm < ATT < 5 mm, and ATT ≥5 mm.

TI  - Single- versus bi-socket anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autogenous multiple-stranded hamstring tendons with EndoButton femoral fixation: A prospective study
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract Purpose: This prospective study was conducted to compare the single-socket and the bi-socket anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction techniques in terms of outcome. Type of Study: Nonrandomized control trial. Methods: There were 160 consecutive patients with unilateral chronic ACL insufficiency who underwent endoscopic single- or bi-socket ACL reconstruction alternately using multiple-stranded medial hamstring tendon and EndoButton (Smith & Nephew, Andover, MD) femoral fixation. All patients underwent the same postoperative rehabilitation protocol. Of them, 106 patients (57 single, 49 bi) were available for 2-year follow-up. Results: According to the IKDC Knee Ligament Evaluation Form, 23 patients (40%) of the single-socket group were subjectively graded as normal, 30 (53%) as nearly normal, and 4 (7%) as abnormal. Twenty-six patients (53%) of the bi-socket group were graded as normal, 21 (43%) as nearly normal, and 2 (4%) as abnormal ( P =.19). The mean side-to-side anterior laxity difference (KT-1000 manual maximum force) was 0.9 ± 1.8 mm for the single-socket group and 0.7 ± 1.2 mm for the bi-socket group ( P =.44). Fifty-three of 57 patients (93%) in the single-socket group and all patients in the bi-socket group showed anterior laxity differences of ±3 mm or less ( P =.12). There were no differences in thigh muscle strength between the groups. Conclusions: Both single- and bi-socket ACL reconstruction using autogenous multiple-stranded hamstring tendons with EndoButton fixation provided satisfactory anterior stability, and there were no statistically significant differences in subjective results or measured restored stability between the 2 groups.

TI  - Twenty-Year Follow-up Study Comparing Operative Versus Nonoperative Treatment of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Ruptures in High-Level Athletes:
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture has major consequences at midterm follow-up, with an increasing chance of developing an old knee in a young patient. The long-term (≥20 years) effects of the operative and nonoperative treatment of ACL ruptures are still unclear. 
Purpose: To compare the long-term treatment outcomes of operative versus nonoperative treatment of ACL ruptures in high-level athletes. 
Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. 
Methods: Fifty patients with an ACL rupture were eligible for participation, and they were treated either nonoperatively (n = 25) in 1992, consisting of structured rehabilitation and lifestyle adjustments, or operatively (n = 25) between 1994 and 1996 with an arthroscopic transtibial bone–patellar tendon–bone technique. The patients in the nonoperative group were drawn from those who responded well to 3 months of nonoperative treatment, whereas the patients in the operative group were drawn from those who had persistent instability after 3 months of nonoperative treatment. Both groups were pair-matched and assessed at 10- and 20-year follow-up regarding radiological knee osteoarthritis, functional outcomes (Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC], Tegner, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score), meniscal status, and knee stability (KT-1000 arthrometer, pivot-shift test, Lachman test, 1-legged hop test). 
Results: All 50 patients (100%) were included in the current study for follow-up. After 20 years, we found knee osteoarthritis in 80% of the operative group compared with 68% of the nonoperative group (P =.508). There was no difference between groups regarding functional outcomes and meniscectomy performed. The median IKDC subjective score was 81.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 59.8-89.1) for the operative group and 78.2 (IQR, 61.5-92.0) for the nonoperative group (P =.679). Regarding the IKDC objective score, 21 patients (84%) in the operative group had a normal or near normal score (A and B) compared with 5 patients (20%) in the nonoperative group (P <.001). The pivot-shift test finding was negative in 17 patients (68%) versus 3 patients (13%) for the operative and nonoperative groups, respectively (P <.001), and the Lachman test finding was negative in 12 patients (48%) versus 1 patient (4%), respectively (P =.002). 
Conclusion: In this retrospective pair-matched follow-up study, we found that after 20-year follow-up, there was no difference in knee osteoarthritis between operative versus nonoperative treatment when treatment was allocated on the basis of a patient’s response to 3 months of nonoperative treatment. Although knee stability was better in the operative group, it did not result in better subjective and objective functional outcomes.

TI  - Clinical, patient-reported, radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings 11 years after acute posterior cruciate ligament injury treated non-surgically.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Long-term consequences of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury such as persistent posterior tibial translation and risk of osteoarthritis development are unclear. Additionally, little data is available describing the natural history of structural morphology of the ruptured PCL. The purpose of the study was to determine the long-term outcome after non-operatively treated PCL injury.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Over 6-years, all acute knee injuries were documented by subacute MRI (median 8 days [5-15, 25th - 75th percentile] from injury to MRI). Twenty-six patients with acute PCL injury were identified of whom 18 (69%) participated in the long-term follow-up after 11 years. Follow-up included radiographic posterior tibial translation (RPTT) determined using the Puddu axial radiograph. weight-bearing knee radiographs, MRI and KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">On subacute MRI, 11 knees displayed total and 7 partial ruptures. At 11 (SD 1.9) years, the median RPTT was 3.7 mm (1.5-6.3, 25th - 75th percentile). Seven knees displayed radiographic osteoarthritis approximating Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≥ 2. All follow-up MRIs displayed continuity of the PCL. Patients with more severe RPTT (&gt; 3.7 mm), had worse scores in the KOOS subscales for symptoms (mean difference 14.5, 95% CI 7-22), sport/recreation (30, 95% CI 0-65) and quality of life (25, 95% CI 13-57) than those with less severe RPTT (≤ 3.7 mm).

TI  - A systematic review of randomized controlled clinical trials comparing hamstring autografts versus bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts for the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament
PY  - 2012
AB  - Objectives Controversies exist over which type of graft is best for the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of ACL reconstruction using either hamstring (HT) autografts or bone-patellar tendonbone (BPTB) autografts. Methods We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE for published randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing HT autografts with BPTB autografts for ACL reconstruction. Data analyses were performed using Cochrane Collaboration RevMan 5.0. Results Nine RCTs (738 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The combined results of the meta-analysis indicated there was a significantly lower rate of negative Pivot test [relative risk (RR) 0.87, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0.79‐0.96, P = 0.004], anterior knee pain (RR 0.66, 95 % CI 0.45‐0.96, P = 0.03) and of kneeling pain (RR 0.49, 95 % CI 0.27‐0.91, P = 0.02) in the HT group than in the BPTB group. Conclusions ACL reconstruction with HT autografts or BPTB autografts achieved similar postoperative effects in terms of restoring knee joint function. HT autografts were inferior to BPTB autografts for restoring knee joint stability, but were associated with fewer postoperative complications.

TI  - The Nonoperative Treatment of Acute, Isolated (Partial or Complete) Posterior Cruciate Ligament-Deficient Knees: An Intermediate-term Follow-up Study
PY  - 2007
AB  - Fifty-seven consecutive patients (58 knees) with an acute, isolated, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury were treated nonoperatively. Clinical, radiographic, and functional assessment was performed at a mean follow-up of 6.9 years (range 2 to 19.3 years) after the initial diagnosis. At the time of initial documentation of the injury, the posterior drawer test was grade A in 17 knees and grade B in 41 knees. The mean preinjury Tegner activity level was 7 (range 4 to 10). At latest follow-up, 38 knees had no pain, 14 had mild pain, and 6 had moderate pain on exertion. Fifty-four knees had no swelling, 3 had mild, intermittent swelling, and 1 had a moderate swelling on exertion. The posterior drawer test was grade A in 14 knees and grade B in 44 knees. The mean Lysholm-II knee score was 85.2 points (range 51 to 100 points) and the mean Tegner activity level was 6.6 (range 3 to 10). Based on Lysholm-II knee scoring system, the results were excellent in 23 knees (40%), good in 30 knees (52%), fair in 2 knees (3%), and poor in 3 knees (5%). No statistically significant correlation (p = 0.097) was seen between the grade of PCL laxity and Lysholm-II knee score. Plain radiographs showed mild (grade I) medial compartment osteoarthritis (OA) in 7 knees, and moderate (grade II) medial compartment OA in 3 knees. Mild patellofemoral OA was seen in 4 knees. We believe that most patients with acute, isolated PCL injuries do well with nonoperative treatment at a mean follow-up of 6.9 years. The level of evidence for this retrospective cohort study is level III.

TI  - No superior treatment for primary osteochondral defects of the talus.
PY  - 2017
AB  - The purpose of this systematic literature review is to detect the most effective treatment option for primary talar osteochondral defects in adults. A literature search was performed to identify studies published from January 1996 to February 2017 using PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, CDSR, DARE, and CENTRAL. Two authors separately and independently screened the search results and conducted the quality assessment using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Subsequently, success rates per separate study were calculated. Studies methodologically eligible for a simplified pooling method were combined. Fifty-two studies with 1236 primary talar osteochondral defects were included of which forty-one studies were retrospective and eleven prospective. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified. Heterogeneity concerning methodological nature was observed, and there was variety in reported success rates. A simplified pooling method performed for eleven retrospective case series including 317 ankles in the bone marrow stimulation group yielded a success rate of 82% [CI 78–86%]. For seven retrospective case series investigating an osteochondral autograft transfer system or an osteoperiosteal cylinder graft insertion with in total 78 included ankles the pooled success rate was calculated to be 77% [CI 66–85%]. For primary talar osteochondral defects, none of the treatment options showed any superiority over others. IV.

TI  - Quadriceps Function and Hamstrings Co-Activation After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2017
AB  - Context:  Individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) have quadriceps dysfunction that contributes to physical disability and posttraumatic knee osteoarthritis. Quadriceps function in the ACLR limb is commonly evaluated relative to the contralateral uninjured limb. Bilateral quadriceps dysfunction is common in individuals with ACLR, potentially biasing these evaluations. Objective:  To compare quadriceps function between individuals with ACLR and uninjured control participants. Design:  Cross-sectional study. Setting:  Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants:  Twenty individuals with unilateral ACLR (age = 21.1 ± 1.7 years, mass = 68.3 ± 14.9 kg, time since ACLR = 50.7 ± 21.3 months; females = 14; Tegner Score = 7.1 ± 0.3; 16 patellar tendon autografts, 3 hamstrings autografts, 1 allograft) matched to 20 control participants (age = 21.2 ± 1.2 years, mass = 67.9 ± 11.3 kg; females = 14; Tegner Score = 7.1 ± 0.4) on age, sex, body mass index, and Tegner Activity Scale.

TI  - Long term results of bone-patella-tendon-bone ACL reconstruction.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Background To assess outcomes of bone-patella-tendon-bone ACL-reconstruction at 18 years follow-up. Material and methods Outcome measures included the IKDC clinical examination form and clinical scores. Radiographs were analyzed to determine the grade of osteoarthritis. Results 69% of the examined patients ( n  = 54) had a normal/nearly normal knee, 14% were abnormal and 17% severely abnormal with significant improvement ( P  ≤ 0.001). The mean Lysholm score was 87.7 ± 12.4 and the Tegner activity level was 5 ± 2. Osteoarthritic changes were present in 52%. Conclusion BPTB ACL-reconstruction provides a satisfactory outcome with a high incidence of radiographic osteoarthritic changes.

TI  - Postoperative septic arthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: does it affect the outcome? A retrospective controlled study.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose To determine whether the outcome after septic arthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is inferior compared with uncomplicated ACLR when treated promptly by use of a standard protocol. Methods At Capio Artro Clinic, 4,384 primary ACLRs were performed during 2001-2009. All patients with postoperative septic arthritis were retrospectively reviewed, and 43 met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-seven patients agreed to re-examination (infection group) and were compared with 27 matched patients with uncomplicated ACLR (control group). The mean follow-up period was 60 months and 66 months in the infection group and control group, respectively. Re-examination included objective (radiographs, physical examination, functional testing, range of motion, strength, stability, International Knee Documentation Committee questionnaire) and subjective (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Tegner score, Lysholm score, European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions, subjective satisfaction questions, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation of knee function, visual analog scale pain rating) evaluation. Results There were no significant differences in objective knee function between the groups at follow-up. For subjective knee function, no significant differences between the groups were detected with the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, pain during activity, or Lysholm score. The infection group scored lower on 4 of 5 Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscales: pain ( P  = .014), function in daily living ( P  = .008), sports/recreation ( P  = .015), and quality of life ( P  = .007). The infection group scored lower versus control patients on the Tegner score ( P  = .001) and European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions scores ( P  = .004). Both groups improved over time, but the control group scored better only on the Tegner score ( P  = .004). Conclusions Septic arthritis after ACLR did not result in inferior objective knee function compared with uncomplicated ACLR. Subjectively, infection patients were as satisfied as non-infection patients, but rehabilitation took longer and fewer patients returned to sports. The findings of this study suggest that anterior cruciate ligament grafts may be retained with prompt, thorough arthroscopic lavage and debridement; correct antibiotics according to cultures; and repeated arthroscopy if necessary. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective case-control therapeutic study.

TI  - Knee instability after acute ACL rupture affects movement patterns during the mid-stance phase of gait.
PY  - 2007
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify gait asymmetries during the mid-stance phase of gait among subjects with knee instability ("non-copers") after acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Twenty-one non-copers with acute, isolated ACL injury ambulated at their intentional walking speed as kinetic, kinematic, and electromyographic (EMG) data were collected bilaterally. Lower extremity movement patterns and muscle activity were analyzed during the mid-stance and weight acceptance phases of stance. When compared to the uninjured limb, subjects exhibited lower sagittal plane knee excursions and peak knee angles, and higher muscle co-contraction on the injured limb. There was a lower knee flexion moment at peak knee extension, a trend for the knee contribution to the total support moment to be lower, and a higher ankle contribution to the total support moment on the injured limb. There were differences in the magnitude of muscle activity which included higher hamstring activity and lower soleus activity on the injured limb. Changes in quadriceps, soleus, and hamstring muscle activity on the injured limb were identified during weight acceptance that had not previously been reported, while hip compensation for a lower knee contribution to the total support moment has been described. Non-copers consistently stabilize their knee with a stiffening strategy involving less knee motion and higher muscle contraction. The variable combination of muscle adaptations that produce joint stiffness, and the ability of both the ankle and the hip to compensate for lower knee control indicate the non-coper neuromuscular system may be more malleable than previously believed.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of double‐ vs single‐bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A systematic review of randomized control trials
PY  - 2012
AB  - Clinical outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with double-bundle and single-bundle techniques are still controversial. We therefore performed a systematic review to compare postoperative outcomes between the two techniques. Randomized control trials comparing the outcomes between the two techniques were identified from Medline and EMBASE since inception to April 27, 2011. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers. Thirteen of 318 studies were eligible; 9, 11, 7, and 8 studies were pooled for rotation, translation, function, and complication outcomes, respectively. The double-bundle technique was approximately four times (95% CI: 2.65, 11.99) and two times (95% CI: 1.16, 5.21) more likely to show a normal pivot shift and normal International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) grading compared with the single-bundle technique. However, there were nonsignificant differences in KT grading (OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 0.77, 3.82), IKDC score (0.29, 95% CI: -1.17, 1.75), Lysholm knee score (-0.87, 95% CI: -2.66, 0.93), Tegner activity score (0.37, 95% CI: -0.05, 0.79), and complications (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.48, 2.57). Heterogeneity was present in some outcomes but there was no evidence of publication bias for any outcome. The double-bundle may be better than the single-bundle ACL reconstruction technique in rotational stability but not for function, translation, and complications.

TI  - Results and Outcomes of Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty
PY  - 2013
AB  - Precise outcome evaluation is mandatory to improve analysis of the results of knee replacement procedures. Patients' expectations toward surgery and activity levels have increased with changes in patient populations and improvement of surgical results. It is difficult, however, to accurately assess outcomes because objective evaluation of patient function performed only by a surgeon remains highly inaccurate. New methods of objective evaluation after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have been developed. These devices provide information about range of motion and patient function during daily activities. This article provides up-to-date information concerning the different tools of function evaluation after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.

          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 206 patients were included (AKP, n = 59; control, n = 147). At the 2-year follow-up, patients with AKP demonstrated a shorter duration in returning to their pre-injury activity level compared to those without AKP (9.0 ± 3.6 vs. 10.3 ± 2.7 months, p &lt; 0.05). RTS earlier than 9 months after MPFLR was the only significant risk factor associated with postoperative AKP (odds ratio, 2.13, 95% confidence interval, 1.03-4.39; p &lt; 0.05). Further subgroup analysis revealed that patient RTS earlier than 9 months exhibited worse patient-reported outcomes in both the total cohort and control group (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, among patient RTS within 9 months, a longer recovery duration before RTS strongly correlated with a higher Kujala score (R = 0.670, p &lt; 0.001).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Young patients who RTS at their pre-injury levels before 9 months after MPFLR have a higher incidence of postoperative AKP and poorer functional outcomes compared to those who delay their return. Specifically, within the first 9 months after MPFLR, the earlier the RTS, the more severe the AKP symptoms. Careful consideration of the timing for RTS may help reduce the incidence of postoperative AKP.</AbstractText>

TI  - Discoid Lateral Meniscus in Children. Long-Term Follow-up After Total Meniscectomy*
PY  - 1998
AB  - We retrospectively reviewed the long-term results of total meniscectomy performed in seventeen knees (fourteen children) to treat a discoid lateral meniscus. The mean duration of follow-up was 19.8 years (range, 12.5 to 26.0 years). On the basis of the rating system of the International Knee Documentation Committee, seven knees were normal (grade A), six were nearly normal (grade B), three were abnormal (grade C), and one was severely abnormal (grade D) at the latest follow-up evaluation. Ten of the seventeen knees had clinical symptoms of osteoarthrosis. Radiographs were available for fifteen of the knees at the latest follow-up evaluation. Eleven of the treated knees could be compared with the uninvolved, contralateral knee. Ten knees had osteoarthrotic changes, such as flattening of the lateral femoral condyle, formation of a ridge along the lateral femoral condyle, and spurring and sclerosis of the tibial plateau. Osteochondritis dissecans developed in two knees, nine and twenty years after the initial meniscectomy.

TI  - Double-bundle ACL reconstruction can improve rotational stability.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction reproduces anteromedial and posterolateral bundles, and thus has theoretical advantages over conventional single-bundle reconstruction in controlling rotational torque in vitro. However, its superiority in clinical practice has not been proven. We analyzed rotational stability with three reconstruction techniques in 60 consecutive patients who were randomly divided into three groups (double-bundle, anteromedial single-bundle, posterolateral single-bundle). In the reconstructive procedure, the hamstring tendon was harvested and used as a free tendon graft. Followup examinations were performed 1 year after surgery. Anteroposterior laxity of the knee was examined with a KT-1000 arthrometer, whereas rotatory instability, as elicited by the pivot shift test, was assessed using a new measurement system incorporating three-dimensional electromagnetic sensors. Routine clinical evaluations, including KT examination, demonstrated no differences among the three groups. However, using the new measurement system, patients with double-bundle ACL reconstruction showed better pivot shift control of complex instability than patients with anteromedial and posterolateral single-bundle reconstruction.

TI  - Allograft Versus Autograft Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: 3- To 5-year Outcome
PY  - 1996
AB  - Sixty-four patients whose knees underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with nonirradiated allograft tissue were compared with 26 patients whose anterior cruciate ligaments were reconstructed using autograft tissue 3 to 5 years after their operation. Detailed symptoms, activity-level, and functional outcomes, physical examination, and instrumented knee testing were recorded. No statistically significant differences were found except a higher incidence of loss of terminal extension in the autograft group. These differences were small and not considered clinically significant. Laxity and knee scores were similar in both groups. According to International Knee Documentation Committee ratings, overall outcome was normal or nearly normal in 48% of the allograft patients and in 38% of the autograft patients. Overall subjective rating with the Cincinnati Knee Score was 85.8 for the allograft patients and 84.5 for the autograft patients. Allograft tissue provides an acceptable alternative to autograft tissue for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

TI  - Three Cases of Patella Fracture in 1,320 Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstructions With Bone–Patellar Tendon–Bone Autograft
PY  - 1999
AB  - Between September 1992 and December 1996 we reviewed three transverse displaced fractures of the patella occuring in 1,320 ACL reconstructions using bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. All the patients suffered local injury to the donor knee between 8 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Immediate rigid fixation using single or double anterior tension band allowed early mobilization and full weight bearing. Between 6 and 9 months after fracture, the screws and the wire were removed and the grafts tested. Results of the pivot shift and Lachman test under anesthesia were negative and arthroscopic visualisation showed the graft to be intact. Postoperative assessment included the Lysholm and Tegner scales, the International Knee Documentation Committee Evaluation form (IKDC), KT-1000 arthrometer, and isokinetic dynamometer strength testing. No significant differences in the final outcome were noted between reconstructions complicated by patellar fracture and normal ACL reconstructions.

TI  - Surgical treatment for a combined anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament avulsion fracture: A case report.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Independent avulsion fractures with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) attachment are relatively common among tibial intercondylar eminence fractures, and their postoperative outcomes are generally favorable. Conversely, huge avulsion fractures of the intercondylar eminence containing the attachment site of both the ACL and the PCL are extremely rare, and the reported clinical outcomes are poor.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CASE SUMMARY" NlmCategory="METHODS">We describe a 30-year-old Japanese male's huge avulsion fracture of the intercondylar eminence of a tibia containing the attachment site of both the ACL and PCL, together with a complete tear of the medial collateral ligament and a partial tear of both the medial and lateral menisci caused by a fall from a high place. All of these injuries were treated surgically, with anatomical reduction and stable fixation. The limb function at 1 year post-surgery was excellent (Lysholm score: 100 points).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Although this patient's complete surgical repair was complex, it should be performed in similar cases for an excellent final clinical outcome.</AbstractText>

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Hyaluronic Acid Intra-articular Injection after Arthroscopic Knee Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">Hyaluronic acid (HA) intra-articular injection after arthroscopic knee surgery has been widely applied but its efficacy and safety remain controversial. The aim of this systematic review is to analyze the efficacy and safety of HA intra-articular injection after arthroscopic knee surgery, and to compare the efficacy of HA with different molecular weights.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, Google scholar and the Cochrane library from inception to 16 September 2022 for English-written articles, in order to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluated the clinical efficacy and/or safety of HA intra-articular injection after arthroscopic knee surgery. Then we meta-analyzed the outcomes of patients given intra-articular HA injections postoperatively and control patients. We also evaluated the influence of HA with different molecular weights. In every calculation, sensitive analysis was performed. The visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and adverse events were selected as the primary outcome measurements, while Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Tegner score were selected as the secondary outcome measurements. Publication bias of every outcome was evaluated using egger test.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Fifteen studies involving 951 knees were included and 12 of them were used to performed the meta-analysis. The results showed no significant difference between the HA group and control group according to VAS, whether assessed at less (P = 0.90) or more than 6 months (P = 0.55). Besides, there were no statistical differences between the HA group and control group according to subgroup analysis (Ps = 0.77, 0.91 and 0.81 in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, meniscectomy and overall groups, respectively). Compared to control group, the overall effect of WOMAC score showed no significant differences (P = 0.25), nor did in two subgroups (P = 0.37 and P = 0.22). Outcomes measured by Lysholm (P = 0.13), IKDC (P = 0.86) and Tegner (P = 0.42) scores showed no significant differences, either. The analysis of the risk of adverse events indicated no increase in HA groups (P = 0.06). We found no significant differences between high- and low-molecular-weight HA at 6 (P = 0.96) or 12 months (P = 0.93) postoperatively. Two studies failed to pass the sensitive analysis and the reasons were discussed detailly and acceptable publication bias was observed.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Although HA injection after arthroscopic knee surgery is safe, the available evidence does not support its efficacy in pain relief and functional recovery. Therefore, the application of HA injection after arthroscopic knee surgery is not recommended.</AbstractText>

TI  - Whole joint MRI assessment of surgical cartilage repair of the knee: Cartilage Repair OsteoArthritis Knee Score (CROAKS)
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary Objective To develop a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scoring system for follow-up of knee cartilage repair procedures integrating assessment of the repair site and the whole joint called Cartilage Repair OsteoArthritis Knee Score (CROAKS), and to assess its reliability. Design MRI examinations of 20 patients that had undergone matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) of the knee 12 months before were semi-quantitatively assessed for the repair site using features of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) system and for the whole joint based on experiences with the MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS) instrument. Intra- and inter-observer reliability was calculated using weighted ( w ) kappa statistics for plates (medial/lateral tibia, medial/lateral femur, trochlea, patella), compartments (medial tibio-femoral, lateral tibio-femoral, patello-femoral) and the whole joint. For certain features with low prevalence the overall percent agreement was calculated in addition. Results For cartilage, reliability on a plate level ranged between 0.48 (lateral femur) and 1.00 (medial femur). BML assessment showed comparable results ranging on a plate level between 0.46 and 1.00 with overall percent agreement between 83.3% and 100%. Meniscal morphology assessment ranged between 0.62 and 0.94. For repair site assessment reliability ranged from 0.41 (signal intensity inter-observer) to 1.00 (several features). Overall percent agreement was above 80% for 17 of 22 features assessed (intra- and inter-observer results combined). Conclusions Combined scoring of the repair site and whole joint assessment for common osteoarthritis features using CROAKS, which is based on experience with two established semi-quantitative scoring tools, is feasible and may be performed with good to excellent reliability.

TI  - Effectiveness of double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction combined with anterolateral ligament reconstruction for revision
PY  - 2021
AB  - Objective To investigate the effectiveness of double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction combined with anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction in the treatment of revision patients with ACL graft failure. Methods Between January 2018 and June 2019, 15 patients underwent ACL revision with double-bundle ACL reconstruction combined with ALL reconstruction. There were 12 males and 3 females with an average age of 30.1 years (range, 17-49 years). The technique of primary ACL reconstruction included single-bundle reconstruction in 13 cases and double-bundle reconstruction in 2 cases. These reconstructions applied autografts in 14 cases and allograft in 1 case. The causes of ACL reconstruction failure were identified as traumatic rupture in 9 cases and non-traumatic failure in 6 cases, including 2 cases of graft absorption and 3 cases of graft laxity. The average time from the primary ACL reconstruction to revision was 28.5 months (range, 8-60 months). The subjective and objective indicators of knee joint function were compared before operation and at last follow-up to evaluate the effectiveness. The subjective indicators included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. The objective indicators included anterior tibial translation (dynamic and static) and side-to-side difference (SSD), pivot-shift test, Lachman test, the difference of single-legged hop test, and the loss ratio of extensor muscle strength on the affected side. Results All incisions healed by first intetion, and no complications such as infection, venous thrombosis of lower extremity, or neurovascular injury occurred. All patients were followed up for an average of 19.1 months (range, 12-30 months). At last follow-up, all patients had returned to pre-injury sports level. The IKDC score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score were significantly improved ( P<0.05); anterior tibial translations (dynamic and static) significantly decreased when compared with preoperative one ( P<0.05) and returned to the physiological range. The SSD, Lachman test, pivot-shift test, the difference of single-legged hop test, and the loss ratio of extensor muscle strength on the affected side were significantly better than those before operation ( P<0.05).During the follow-up, there was no re-rupture of the graft, no stiffness of the knee joint and limitation of mobility; 1 case had a protruding femoral end compression screw, which was removed through the original incision under local anesthesia. Conclusion Double-bundle ACL reconstruction combined with ALL reconstruction can significantly improve the knee function in revision patients with ACL graft failure. It can reduce the anterior translation of tibia, and effectively prevent postoperative rotational instability of the knee.

TI  - No risk of arthrofibrosis after acute anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2017
AB  - To compare acute ACL reconstruction (ACLR) within 8 days of injury with delayed reconstruction after normalized range of motion (ROM), 6–10 weeks after injury. It was hypothesized that acute ACL reconstruction with modern techniques is safe and can be beneficial in terms of patient-reported outcomes and range of motion. Sample size calculation indicated 64 patients would be required to find a 5° difference in ROM at 3 months. Seventy patients with high recreational activity level, Tegner level 6 or more, were randomized to acute (within 8 days) or delayed (6–10 weeks) ACLR between 2006 and 2013. During the first 3 months following surgery patients were contacted weekly by SMS and asked ‘How is your knee functioning?’, with answers given on a Visual-Analog Scale (0–10). ROM was assessed after 3 months by the rehab physiotherapist. Patient-reported outcomes, objective IKDC and manual stability measurements were collected by an independent physiotherapist not involved in the rehab at the 6-month follow-up. At 3-month follow-up, 91% of the patients were assessed with no significant differences in flexion, extension or total ROM demonstrated between groups. At the 6-month follow-up, the acute group had significantly less muscle atrophy of the thigh muscle compared to the contralateral leg. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the acute group passed or were close to passing the one leg hop test (47 versus 21%, p = 0.009). No difference was found between the groups in the other clinical assessments. Additionally, no significant difference between the groups was found in terms of associated injuries. Acute ACLR within 8 days of injury does not appear to adversely affect ROM or result in increased stiffness in the knee joint when compared to delayed surgery. II.

TI  - Graft infection following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a report of four cases
PY  - 2014
AB  - Septic arthritis following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL) is a rare complication and associated with severe morbidity. Its risk factors include (1) concomitant procedures during the reconstruction, (2) previous knee surgery, (3) allograft usage, (4) peri-operative wound contamination, and (5) presence of intra-articular foreign bodies. We present a series of 3 men and one woman aged 22 to 35 years who developed septic arthritis following ACL reconstruction. The risk factors identified were local infection (n=2), previous ipsilateral knee surgery (n=2), and the use of an allograft (n=1). All patients underwent emergency knee washout and debridement with graft retention within 24 hours, together with a course of intravenous antibiotic therapy. All the patients achieved eradication of their infections (with intact ACL grafts) and satisfactory functional outcome at a mean follow-up of 32 (range, 25-45) months.

TI  - Medial Meniscus Scaffold Implantation in Combination with Concentrated Bone Marrow Aspirate Injection: Minimum 3-Year Follow-up
PY  - 2020
AB  - The objective of this study is to show the short-term clinical and radiological outcomes of concentrated bone marrow aspirate (CBMA) injection administered in combination with medial meniscus scaffold implantation. Twenty-three patients who received intra-articular CBMA injection in combination with polyurethane-based medial meniscus scaffold implantation were evaluated within the scope of this study. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) questionnaire and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were used to evaluate the results, and the visual analog scale was used to assess the pain scores. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained in the preoperative period and at postoperative months 1, 12, 24, and 36 to assess the scaffold position as well as chondral degeneration/damage in a comparative manner. MRI assessment was performed by using the modified Outerbridge scale for cartilage and the Genovese scoring system for the meniscal implant. Twenty-three patients who were included in the study were evaluated for a mean follow-up period of 38.3 months. Patients exhibited statistically significant improvement according to all scoring data from the preoperative period until the follow-up period. The mean postoperative extrusion at year 3 was 2.39 mm (distribution 2.30–2.56 mm). There was no significant difference in the distribution of the degree of chondral damage between the preoperative and 3-year follow-up periods. Four patients did not show any improvement nor had lower scores according to the assessment. Medial meniscus scaffold implantation combined with intra-articular CBMA injection resulted in a significant improvement in all functions and pain scores as well as a statistically significant clinical improvement in IKDC and KOOS values in the short-term follow-up. The Level of evidence for this study is IV.

TI  - Anteromedial Tibial Tubercle Osteotomy Improves Results of Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction for Recurrent Patellar Instability in Patients With Tibial Tuberosity-Trochlear Groove Distance of 17 to 20 mm.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Purpose To compare the midterm clinical outcomes of anteromedialization tibial tubercle osteotomy combined with medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (TTO+MPFLR) with MPFLR alone (MPFLRa) for the treatment of recurrent patellar instability (RPI) in patients with a tibial tuberosity–trochlear groove (TT-TG) of 17 to 20 mm. Methods From January 2008 to August 2013, patients with RPI and a TT-TG of 17 to 20 mm were divided into 2 groups: TTO+MPFLR or MPFLRa. Subjects were evaluated for J sign classification (1-4+); patellar glide (1-4+); the apprehension test; increased femoral anteversion; the Caton index; trochlear dysplasia; TT-TG; and Kujala, Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner scores. Kujala improvement was the primary outcome. Results Forty-two subjects were evaluated, 18 in the TTO+MPFLR group and 24 in the MPFLRa group. Mean follow-up time was 40.86 months (range, 24-60 months). Demographics between the groups were not different. Preoperatively, there was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding J sign classification; patellar glide; the apprehension test; increased femoral anteversion; the Caton index; trochlear dysplasia; TT-TG; and Kujala, Lysholm, IKDC, and Tegner scores. Postoperative J sign classification mean results comparing TTO+MPFLR and MPFLRa, respectively, were 1 and 1.33 (P = .006). Improvement was significantly higher in the TTO+MPFLR group in all scores except for Tegner. Kujala improvement, 30.27 and 23.95, respectively (P = .003), was also clinically significant, favoring TTO+MPFLR. Lysholm improvement was 40.5 and 36.2, respectively (P = .02), and IKDC improvement was 38.59 and 31.6, respectively (P = .002). There were no reported recurrent subluxations or dislocations in either group. Conclusions TTO+MPFLR resulted in better functional outcome scores and patellar kinematics compared with MPFLRa in the surgical treatment of RPI in patients with a TT-TG distance of 17 to 20 mm. Level of Evidence Level II, prospective comparative study.

          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To assess whether arthrometric knee laxity (measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer) 6 months after primary ACLR was associated with the 1-, 2-, and 5-year subjective knee outcomes or revision ACLR at a 5-year follow-up.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study, Level of evidence 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Patients who underwent primary ACLR with a hamstring tendon autograft at the authors' institution between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2017, with no concomitant ligamentous injuries, were identified. Anterior knee laxity (KT-1000 arthrometer, 134 N) was assessed 6 months postoperatively. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was collected preoperatively and 1, 2, and 5 years postoperatively. Patients who underwent revision ACLR at any institution in the country within 5 years of primary surgery were identified through the Swedish National Knee Ligament Registry.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 4697 patients (54.3% male) with available KT-1000 arthrometer measurements were included (normal: side-to-side [STS] ≤2 mm, 3015 [64.2%]; nearly normal: STS 3-5 mm, 1446 [30.8%]; abnormal: STS &gt;5 mm, 236 [5.0%]). The only significant difference in subjective knee outcome between the groups was for the KOOS Symptoms subscale at the 1-year follow-up (STS ≤2 mm, 79.9 ± 16.2; STS 3-5 mm, 82.5 ± 14.8; STS &gt;5 mm, 85.1 ± 14.2; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). No other significant differences between the groups were found preoperatively or at 1, 2, or 5 years postoperatively for any of the KOOS subscales. The hazard for revision ACLR within 5 years of the primary surgery was significantly higher for the groups with an STS of 3 to 5 mm (6.6%; 95/1446) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07-1.87; <i>P</i> = .01) and an STS &gt;5 mm (11.4%; 27/236) (HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.69-4.03; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) compared with the group with an STS ≤2 mm (3.8%; 116/3015).</AbstractText>

TI  - Effect of High-Grade Preoperative Knee Laxity on Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Outcomes
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background:Knee laxity in the setting of suspected anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is frequently assessed through physical examination using the Lachman, pivot-shift, and anterior drawer tests. The degree of laxity noted on these examinations may influence treatment decisions and prognosis.Hypothesis:Increased preoperative knee laxity would be associated with increased risk of subsequent revision ACL reconstruction and worse patient-reported outcomes 2 years postoperatively.Study Design:Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.Methods:From an ongoing prospective cohort study, 2333 patients who underwent primary isolated ACL reconstruction without collateral or posterior cruciate ligament injury were identified. Patients reported by the operating surgeons as having an International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) grade D for Lachman, anterior drawer, or pivot-shift examination were classified as having high-grade laxity.

TI  - Suture tape reinforcement of hamstring tendon graft reduces postoperative knee laxity after primary ACL reconstruction.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To evaluate and compare subjective and objective knee outcomes following hamstring tendon (HT) and quadriceps tendon (QT) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with or without suture tape (ST) reinforcement. It was hypothesized that the addition of an intra-articular synthetic augmentation with a ST would reduce postoperative knee laxity and graft ruptures after ACLR.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A 1:1 matched-cohort comparison of patients who underwent HT and QT autograft ACLR with or without ST reinforcement was performed. Patients with ST reinforcement were consecutively assigned to the study groups until a number of 20 in each group was achieved. Medical records were reviewed for demographic characteristics and additional injuries. Laxity measurements with KT-1000, strength measurements and physical examination findings were collected both preoperatively and at 6 months and patient reported outcome (PRO) scores were collected both preoperatively and at 12 months, and comparison was made HT vs HT + ST and QT vs QT + ST. Reoperations and re-ruptures were recorded during the 24-month follow-up period.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Overall, 80 patients who underwent ACLR were included. Patients with HT + ST had significant less laxity postoperatively compared to HT at 6 months, 1.9 vs 0.8 mm, p &lt; 0.05. No differences were found between the QT and QT + ST group. At 6 weeks patients treated with ST, both QT and HT, had a significant deficit in flexion compared to those without ST. However, this resolved at 6 months. There were no significant differences between HT + ST vs HT, or QT + ST vs QT, regarding postoperative PROs or strength measurements. Furthermore, the incidence of subsequent surgery and graft rupture was not significantly different between the groups.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">ACLR with HT + ST reduces laxity at 6 months compared to ACLR without ST, a difference not seen when ACLR was performed using QT with or without ST. No other differences were seen between the two techniques comparing subjective and objective findings.</AbstractText>

TI  - WITHDRAWN: Interventions for treating posterior cruciate ligament injuries of the knee in adults.
PY  - 2012
AB  - BACKGROUND Injuries of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) of the knee frequently occur in automobile accidents and sports injuries, although they are less frequent overall than injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Some patients show significant symptoms and subsequent articular deterioration, while others are essentially asymptomatic, maintaining habitual function. Management of PCL injuries remains controversial and prognosis can vary widely. Interventions extend from non-operative (conservative) procedures to reconstruction of the PCL, in the hope that the surgical procedure may have a positive effect in the reduction/prevention of future osteoarthritic changes in the knee. OBJECTIVES To determine the effectiveness and safety of surgical and conservative interventions for PCL injuries in adults. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (April 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to April 2004), EMBASE (1966 to April 2004), CINAHL (1982 to April 2004), LILACS (1982 to April 2004), SportsDiscus (1975 to April 2004), and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing various methods of operative and conservative interventions, and comparisons with each other for the treatment of PCL injuries. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS References found with the search strategy were evaluated independently by two review authors. MAIN RESULTS No randomized or quasi-randomized controlled studies meeting the selection criteria were identified. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Future research should include randomized controlled trials of acute isolated PCL injuries, or PCL injuries when combined with other ligament injuries of the knee, treated operatively and conservatively. Adequate numbers of patients and an objective methodology for patient evaluation must be used in future studies of these interventions to determine the long-term results.

PY  - 2004
AB  - BackgroundBracing after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is expensive and is not proven to prevent injuries or influence outcomes.PurposeTo determine whether postoperative functional knee bracing influences outcomes.Study DesignProspective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial.MethodsOne hundred volunteers from the 3 US service academies with acute anterior cruciate ligament tears were randomized into braced or nonbraced groups. Only those subjects with anterior cruciate ligament tears treated surgically within the first 8 weeks of injury were included. Patients with chondral injuries, significant meniscal tears, or multiple knee ligament injuries were excluded. Surgical procedures and the postoperative physical therapy protocols were identical for both groups. The braced group was instructed to wear an off-the-shelf functional knee brace for all cutting, pivoting, or jumping activities for the first year after surgery.ResultsNinety-five subjects were available with a minimum 2-year follow-up. ...

TI  - Meniscal polyurethane scaffold plus cartilage repair in post meniscectomy syndrome patients without malalignment improves clinical outcomes at mid-term follow-up.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Background The aim of this study is to report the mid-term follow-up results of a prospective cohort of patients who underwent a polyurethane (PU) meniscal scaffold implantation for post meniscectomy syndrome (PMS), without limb realignment procedures. Methods Prospective study in patients with PU meniscal scaffolds implanted during 2014–2016. Limb realignment procedures excluded. Clinical outcomes were prospectively evaluated pre-operatively and every year post-operatively using patient-reported outcome scores (KOOS, VAS, Lysholm and IKDC). Post-operative radiologic evaluation was done using 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Meniscal scaffold extrusion, signal intensity, tibio-femoral cartilage degeneration progression and complications were analyzed. Results Fourteen patients with an average age of 25.8 years (range: 17–47) received a PU scaffold (8 lateral and 6 medial). Associated procedures were done in all patients, with an osteochondral allograft transplantation (OAT) being the most common. Mean follow up was 51.6 (range: 39–66) months. Post-operative mean clinical outcomes scores showed significantly improved results compared to the pre-operative scores. Lysholm scores increased from 62.4 to 80.2 (P = 0.0023), KOOS from 68.9 to 80 (P = 0.0083) and VAS for pain decreased from 5.3 to 3.1 (P = 0.0024). Average post-operative IKDC score was 67.7. There were 8 cases of complete extrusion (>3 mm). The mean extrusion value was 4.0 mm (range: 3–6 mm). Three patients showed signs of a ruptured meniscal scaffold. One patient showed progression of the cartilage degenerative process. Conclusion The use of a PU scaffold, associated with other surgical procedures in the knee, especially chondral repair, had a significant improvement in clinical outcomes compared to the baseline status, at an average of 51.6 months follow-up in patients suffering from PMS. Although imaging results show a high proportion of implant extrusion, this does not appear to imply a worsening in clinical outcomes in the short term. Level of evidence IV. Case series.

TI  - Creating Crosswalks for Knee Outcomes After ACL Reconstruction Between the KOOS and the IKDC-SKF.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) registries do not all use the same patient-reported outcome measures, limiting comparisons and preventing pooling of data for meta-analysis. Our objective was to create a statistical crosswalk to convert cohort and registry mean Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS) to International Knee Documentation Committee-Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) scores and vice versa to allow these comparisons.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">Data from 3 ACL registries were pooled (n = 14,412) and were separated into a training data set (70% of the sample) or a validation data set (30% of the sample). The KOOS and the IKDC-SKF scores were available prior to the operation and at 1, 2, and 5 or 6 years postoperatively. We used equipercentile equating methods to create crosswalks in the training data set and examined accuracy in the validation data set as well as bootstrapping analyses to assess the impact of sample size on accuracy.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Preliminary analyses suggested that crosswalks could be attempted: large correlations between scores on the 2 measures (r = 0.84 to 0.94), unidimensionality of scores, and subpopulation invariance were deemed sufficient. When comparing actual scores with crosswalked scores in the validation data set, negligible bias was observed at the group level; however, individual score deviations were variable. The crosswalks are successful for the group level only.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">Our crosswalks successfully convert between the KOOS and the IKDC-SKF scores to allow for a group-level comparison of registry and other cohort data.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CLINICAL RELEVANCE">These crosswalks allow comparisons among different national ligament registries as well as other research cohorts and studies; they also allow data from different patient-reported outcome measures to be pooled for meta-analysis. These crosswalks have great potential to improve our understanding of recovery after ACL reconstruction and aid in our ongoing efforts to improve outcomes and patient satisfaction, as well as to allow the continued analysis of historical data.</AbstractText>

TI  - Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Surgeon-Reported Causes of Failure From the Norwegian Knee Ligament Register.
PY  - 2025
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Failed anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) leads to reduced quality of life and sometimes the need for repeat surgery. The reason for failure can be multifactorial and difficult to determine. Reports on failure leading to revision are few with limited generalizability. Also, no studies have investigated the reasons for early (&lt;2 years) versus late (≥2 years) revision.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To describe patients undergoing revision surgery, the surgeon's reported cause of failure, and the risk of undergoing early versus late revision surgery.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Primary ACLR cases without concomitant ligament injuries or surgery, registered in the Norwegian Knee Ligament Register from 2004 throughout 2023, were eligible. Descriptive analyses were conducted on intraoperative findings and procedures, time from injury to surgery, activity at the time of injury, revision surgery, surgeon-reported cause of revision, and reporting method. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate revision rates. A multivariable Cox regression model, adjusted for confounders, was used to calculate the hazard ratio of early and late revision surgery.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 30,035 primary ACLR cases were analyzed, of which 1599 resulted in revision surgery. The overall revision rate was 7.1% at 15 years. Female patients were younger at the time of both primary and revision surgery (23.8 and 22.5 years, respectively) compared with male patients (28.2 and 22.2 years, respectively). Age at the time of primary surgery was significantly lower for patients who underwent revision (20.4 years) compared with those who did not undergo revision (26.5 years). Male sex, lower age, hamstring tendon graft, and no cartilage injury at the time of primary reconstruction were all associated with a higher risk of early revision. Lower age, hamstring tendon graft, and no meniscal injury were associated with a higher risk of late revision. New trauma (38.1%) was found to be the most common cause of failure leading to revision.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">In the current study, representing one of the largest cohorts to date investigating failed primary ACLR leading to revision, the overall 15-year revision rate was estimated as 7.1%. Patients receiving hamstring tendon grafts were at a particular risk for early revision during the first 2 years after primary reconstruction. New trauma was the most common reported cause of failure leading to revision ACLR.</AbstractText>

TI  - Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using a 2-Stage Technique With Bone Grafting of the Tibial Tunnel
PY  - 2005
AB  - BackgroundRevision anterior cruciate ligament surgery is often considered a salvage procedure with limited goals. However, this limitation need not be the case. Similar to primary reconstruction, the goal should be to choose an appropriate graft and place it in an anatomical position in a good quality bone. The issue of good quality bone seems to have been ignored.HypothesisA 2-stage anterior cruciate ligament revision reconstruction with bone grafting of the tibial tunnel and the use of a different femoral tunnel will produce measured knee laxity and International Knee Documentation Committee scores similar to a primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.Study DesignCase control study; Level of evidence, 3.MethodsThis prospective study involved 49 consecutive 2-stage anterior cruciate ligament revisions (group R) performed by a single surgeon from 1993 to 2000. Two-stage revision surgery was performed if the tibial tunnel from a previous reconstruction surgery would overlap (either partially or fu...

TI  - S2k Guideline for Tibial Plateau Fractures - Classification, Diagnosis, and Treatment.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Tibial plateau fractures are mostly complex and surgically demanding joint fractures, which require a comprehensive understanding of the fracture morphology, ligamentous and neurovascular injuries, as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic options for an optimal clinical outcome. Therefore, a standardised and structured approach is required. The success of the treatment of tibial plateau fractures relies on the interdisciplinary cooperation between surgical and conservative physicians in an outpatient and inpatient setting, physical therapists, patients and service providers (health insurance companies, statutory accident insurance, pension providers). On behalf of the German Society for Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery (DGOU), the German Trauma Society (DGU) and the Society for Arthroscopy and Joint Surgery (AGA), under the leadership of the Fracture Committee of the German Knee Society (DKG), a guideline for tibial plateau fractures was created, which was developed in several voting rounds as part of a Delphi process. Based on the current literature, this guideline is intended to make clear recommendations and outline the most important treatment steps in diagnostics, therapy and follow-up treatment. Additionally, 25 statements were revised by the authors in several survey rounds using the Likert scale in order to reach a final consensus.

TI  - Has platelet-rich plasma any role in anterior cruciate ligament allograft healing?
PY  - 2009
AB  - Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the clinical and inflammatory parameters with the addition of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with bone‐patellar tendon‐bone allograft.Methods:We prospectively randomized 100 patients undergoing arthroscopic patellar tendon allograft ACL reconstruction to a group in whom platelet-enriched gel was used (n!50) and a non-gel group (n!50). The platelet concentration was 837"10 3 /mm 3 , and the gel was introduced inside the graft and the tibial tunnel. Demographic data were comparable between groups. The mean follow-up was 24 months for both groups and included a history, clinical evaluation with the International Knee Documentation Committee score, radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging.Results:There were no differences in the number of associated injuries. The results did not show any statistically significant differences between the groups for inflammatory parameters (perimeters of the knee and C-reactive protein level), magnetic resonance imaging appearance of the graft, and clinical evaluation scores (visual analog scale, International Knee Documentation Committee, and KT-1000 arthrometer [MEDmetric, San Diego, CA]).Conclusions:At this time, the therapeutic role of PDGF in ACL reconstruction remains unclear. The use of PDGF, on the graft and inside the tibial tunnel, in patients treated with bone‐patellar tendon‐bone allografts has no discernable clinical or biomechanical effect at 2 years’ follow-up. More clinical studies will be needed to show the efficacy and use of these factors in daily practice in ACL reconstruction.Level of Evidence:Level I, prospective, randomized, double-blind study.Key Words:Platelet-derived growth factor—Anterior cruciate ligament—Allograft.

TI  - Factors predicting functional and radiographic outcomes after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy: a review of the literature.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Abstract We reviewed articles examining the associations between factors identifiable before or during arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) and functional and radiographic outcomes. We assessed the magnitude of effect and statistical significance of associations between predictor variables and outcomes within each study. We then qualitatively synthesized these observations across multiple studies. Twenty-five studies met our criteria for inclusion. Eight of the studies had a prospective design. There were no randomized, controlled trials. The studies had important methodological limitations. Greater size of meniscal resection and female gender showed the strongest and most consistent associations with greater radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis across multiple studies. Greater articular cartilage degeneration assessed at surgery, greater size of meniscal resection, greater laxity of the anterior cruciate ligament, and prior surgery on the index knee were the strongest predictors of worse functional outcomes. Patients with worse preoperative health status (SF-36 score

TI  - Failure risks in anatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction via the outside-in tunnel technique using a hamstring autograft.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Purpose To retrospectively evaluate the failure risk factors in anatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction via outside-in tunnel technique using a hamstring autograft, and investigate the relationship between each risk factor. Methods The patients who underwent the ACL reconstruction with a minimum 1-year follow-up were included. We divided the patients into two groups – those who experienced graft failure (the failure group) and those who did not experience graft failure (the no failure group) – and compared their age, height, weight, sports activity level, graft size, and muscle strength. We defined graft failure as patients who underwent revision ACL reconstruction or had a second injurious ACL episode and those with a graft grade of C or D based on the International Knee Documentation Committee score. Results The study included 232 patients (101 male, 131 female; mean age at operation was 26.1 ± 11.9 years). The failure rate was 11.6% (failure group: 27 patients; no failure group: 205 patients). The patients in the failure group were younger and had higher sports activity level than those in the no failure group. (p  Conclusion Young age, high activity sports level, low body weight, small graft diameter of the tibial side, high quadriceps strength at 6 months, and low H/Q ratio at 3 and 6 months can be failure risk factors in anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction via the outside-in tunnel technique using a hamstring autograft.

TI  - Comparison of single-bundle versus double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction after a minimum of 3-year follow-up: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Both single-bundle (SB) and double-bundle (DB) procedures have been widely used in the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture; however, the optimal repair strategy remains considerably controversial. In this meta-analysis of published studies, we compared the results of these two techniques. After systematic review of electronic databases and websites, a total of 8 RCTs reporting data on 941 subjects were included. The objective and subjective functional recovery outcomes were meta-analyzed. The methodological quality was evaluated using the CBRG scale. The overall pooled data showed superiority in rotational stability, the degree of osteoarthritis (OA) changes, and subjective function score postoperatively in patients managed with DB compared with the SB procedure (pivot shift test, P = 0.02; degree of OA, P = 0.02; Lysholm score, P = 0.04; and Tegner scale, P = 0.002, respectively). However, subgroup analysis suggested no difference between the treatment procedures at long-term follow-up. This meta-analysis demonstrated that the DB technique could result in better rotational stability and higher subjective function score and was effective in preventing OA compared to SB in the mid-term treatment of the injured ACL. Further studies with better design involving larger sample sizes and longer-term follow-up are required.

TI  - Comorbidity-related quality of life in anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency
PY  - 2008
AB  - Background and purpose Comorbidity-adjusted health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in anterior cruci-ate ligament insufﬁciency (ACLI) has not been assessed to date. A cross-sectional study was conducted to test the hypothesis that HRQoL in ACLI is comorbidity-related and differs from the Italian norm.Methods 282 chronically ACL-insufﬁcient candi-dates for arthroscopic reconstruction with or without meniscal and/or focal chondral lesions were studied. Knee function was evaluated with IKDC form, HRQoL with SF-36, and associated medical comorbidities with a self-administered questionnaire allowing calculation of a comorbidity index (CI). Patients were stratiﬁed according to CI into subgroup A (CI = 0) and subgroup B (CI > 0). The SF-36 proﬁles in the whole sample and in subgroups A and B were compared with the Italian norm.Results Of the 282 patients, 82 had associated comorbidity and 200 did not. Patients with comorbidity were older and had a higher degree of knee laxity than patients without comorbidity. Distinctive SF-36 proﬁles were obtained after stratiﬁcation by comorbidity and comparison with the age- and sex-matched norm. The SF-36 proﬁle in subgroup A showed statistically signiﬁ-cantly lower scores on the PF, RP, BP, and SF domains while the GH and MH domains were statistically signiﬁ-cantly higher than the norm. Subgroup B showed statis-tically signiﬁcantly lower scores than the norm for the PF, RP, BP, VT, SF and RE domains. Interpretation Comorbidity-related HRQoL in ACL-insufﬁcient candidates for arthroscopic reconstruction showed statistically signiﬁcant differences from the norm. Comorbid illness acting as confounder should thus be controlled for when reporting SF-36 proﬁles, in order to avoid selection bias. Our ﬁndings may also be used as benchmark data for researchers investigating SF-36 proﬁles in ACLI.

TI  - Comparison of arthroscopic one-incision and two-incision techniques for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.
PY  - 1999
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction performed using either the 'one-incision' technique or the rear-entry 'two-incision' technique. A series of 221 consecutive patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was reviewed retrospectively. In the study population, two subgroups were defined. Group A consisted of 118 patients who underwent reconstruction using the one-incision transtibial endoscopic technique and Group B consisted of 103 patients who underwent reconstruction using the two-incision technique. The groups were comparable in terms of age, sex and activity level. The follow-up was performed after 47 (40-68) months in Group A and 55 (40-68) months in Group B. The Lysholm score at the final follow-up was significantly lower in Group A (90, 38-100) than in Group B (94, 34-100) (P = 0.002). The median KT-1000 total side-to-side difference was 1.5 (-6 to 7.5) mm in Group A, and 2.0 (-3.5 to 9) mm in Group B (n.s.). No significant difference between the groups was found when the IKDC evaluation system was used. Four intra-operative complications were registered in Group A and none in Group B (P = 0.06). No significant difference was found in terms of anterior knee pain, the one-leg-hop quotient or the activity level at the final follow-up. In this study the two methods gave similar and satisfactory results. Serious intraoperative complications were, however, recorded in four cases when the one-incision technique was used.

TI  - RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT : COMPARISON OF OUTSIDE-IN AND ALL-INSIDE TECHNIQUES
PY  - 1999
AB  - The aim of this prospective study was to compare two arthroscopic techniques for reconstructing the anterior cruciate ligament, the "outside-in" (two incisions) and the "all-inside" (one incision) techniques. The results obtained for 30 patients operated on using the "outside-in" technique (group I) were compared with those for 29 patients operated on using the "all-inside" technique (group II). Before surgery, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of Lysholm score, Tegner activity level, patellofemoral pain score, or knee laxity. Both groups displayed significant improvements in Lysholm score after 24 months, from 69 (16) to 91 (9) in group I and from 70 (17) to 90 (15) in group II (means (SD)). There were also significant improvements in patellofemoral pain scores in both groups, from 13 (6) to 18 (5) in group I and from 14 (6) to 18 (4) in group II after 24 months. No difference was found between the groups in knee stability at the 24 month follow up. The IKDC score was identical in both groups at follow up. The operation took significantly longer for patients in group I (mean 94 (15)) than for those in group II (mean 86 (20)) (p = 0.03). The mean sick leave was 7.7 (6.2) weeks in group I and 12.3 (9.7) weeks in group II (p = 0.026), indicating that there may be a higher morbidity associated with the "all-inside" technique. It can be concluded that there were no significant differences between the two different techniques in terms of functional results, knee laxity, or postoperative complications. The results were satisfactory and the outcome was similar in both treatment groups.

TI  - First-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation in patients with cartilage defects of the knee: 7 to 14 years' clinical and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up evaluation.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the overall long-term improvement of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) treatment in terms of patient satisfaction, clinical assessment, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation. Furthermore, we aimed to assess the impact of independent variables on clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. Methods We evaluated 23 patients (mean age, 30.5 ± 8.2 years) with full-thickness chondral lesions of the distal femur who underwent first-generation ACI with periosteum between 1997 and 2004. The Lysholm score, Tegner activity score, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee score, numeric rating scale score, and Short Form 36 score were used for clinical assessment preoperatively, at 1 year postoperatively, and at 7 to 14 years (mean, 9.9 years) after surgery. MRI was performed to evaluate the cartilage preoperatively and at final follow-up, by use of the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score. Results ACI resulted in a substantial improvement in all clinical outcome parameters, even as much as 14 years after implantation, although a small deterioration was noticed between intermediate and final evaluations in some outcome parameters. Of the patients, 73.1% stated that they would undergo the operation again. Younger patients with a shorter duration of preoperative symptoms and smaller defect sizes benefited most. MRI findings confirmed complete defect filling in 52.3% of the patients at final follow-up. Conclusions Our long-term results confirm that first-generation ACI is an effective treatment for large full-thickness chondral and osteochondral lesions of the knee joint. Younger patients with a shorter duration of preoperative symptoms and smaller defect size benefited most in our study. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Evaluation of Outcomes after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Children and Adolescents
PY  - 2015
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTreatment for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in paediatric patients has been a long-discussed issue because of complications associated with ligament reconstruction in the presence of growth plates.Various fixation materials and their efficiency as well as ACL techniques are still under investigation.The aim of our study was to find an optimal strategy of treating acute intra-articular ACL injury in childhood. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe paediatric patients treated for primary traumatic ACL injury between 2003 and 2013 were retrospectively evaluated.Only patients with a healthy contralateral knee (with no signs of instability or previous injury) and no record of previous ACL repair were included.A total of 78 patients were assessed; there were 39 girls and 39 boys with an average age of 15.4 years (11 -16).The physical development of the patients was assessed on the Tanner scale, their satisfaction was recorded on the basis of the IKDC subjective knee evaluation form and the Tegner-Lysholm scoring system.The instrumented Lachman test using a rollimeter was performed to assess knee stability at 12 and 24 months of follow-up.In addition, the range of knee motion in comparison with the other side, complications and the re-rupture rate of reconstructed ACLs were recorded.Four patients with open growth plates were operated on using the transepiphyseal technique, the remaining 74 underwent reconstruction by the standard transphyseal method. RESULTSThe average Tegner-Lysholm scores were 54 (41-62) pre-operatively and 86.1 (74-96) at 24 months post-operatively.The average IKDC score increased from 48 (42-56) points to 91 (73-97) points.The Lachman test was positive in all patients before ACL reconstruction and negative in 96% of them at 12 and 24 months after surgery.The full range of joint motion was restored after ACL surgery, with minimal motion restriction in flexion and extension, in 70 (89.7%)patients.Motion restriction by 15° or less in flexion and 5° or less in extension was recorded in seven (9%) patients and a significant restriction in extension exceeding 10° was found in one (1.3%)patient.No differences in results were found between the two scoring systems.Five patients (6.4 %) sustained a re-tear in the reconstructed ACL due to a trauma.Non-traumatic subjective instability after the primary repair was not recorded.Revision ACL surgery was carried out due to fixation materials protruding from the bone surface in two patients and because of a Cyclops lesion with extension deficit in one patient.No development of deformity or instability was observed at 24 months in the patients in whom the transepiphyseal technique was used. DISCUSSIONIn the current literature ACL reconstruction by the transphyseal technique has been described in patients older than 15 years of age but no optimal age has been suggested.Animal experiments have shown that tunnels taking up more that 7-9% of the growth plate surface can result in growth restriction or angular deformity.ACL reconstruction in patients with distinct bone immaturity carries a high risk.The effect of growth on the biomechanical properties of a graft and a long-term consequence of surgical intervention in the growth plate is not yet understood. CONSLUSIONSAlthough indications for surgical ACL repair and its timing are bound to be different in each patient, we consider the age of over 15 years to be ideal for ACL reconstruction.In patients younger than 15 years, the necessity of surgical treatment is questionable and conservative therapy can give good outcomes.No adverse effect of an applied graft on the post-operative results was demonstrated.The features of an immature skeleton are specific and complicated therefore, in our view, the relevant health care for paediatric patients should be concentrated into specialised institutions.

TI  - Publication trends and global productivity about the anterior cruciate ligament: a bibliometric analysis between 1980-2021
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p xml:lang="en">Aim: Due to anatomic, biomechanical, kinematic, biological and clinical data obtained as a result of many studies related to treatment and rehabilitation of injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), among the most studied anatomic structures in the human body, the literature is continuously being updated and improved. In this study, the aim was to holistically analyze scientific articles about the ACL published between 1980 and 2021 using a variety of statistical methods.&#x0D;
Material and Method: Articles published from 1980 to 2021 about the ACL were obtained from the Web of Science (WoS) database and analyzed using statistical methods and bibliometric approaches. To identify trend topics and global cooperation, and to complete citation analysis, network visualization maps were used. The exponential smoothing predictor was used to predict the number of articles that will be published in the next 5 years. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used for correlation research.&#x0D;
Results: A total of 11,077 publications were identified. Of these publications, 9101 (82.1%) were articles. The top 3 countries contributing most to the literature were the USA (3894, 42.7%), Japan (879, 9.6%) and Germany (616, 6.7%). The top 3 active organizations were Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (n=468), University of Pittsburgh (440), and University of California system (279). The top 3 journals publishing most articles were the American Journal of Sports Medicine (n=1614), Knee Surgery Sports Traumatology Arthroscopy (1418), and Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery (915). The most effective journal according to mean number of citations per article was the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (average citation per document: 80.7). The most active author was Freddie H. Fu (n=278, from University of Pittsburgh).&#x0D;
Conclusion: In this comprehensive bibliometric research about the topic of ACL, with a trend toward increasing publication numbers in recent years, the summary information for 9101 articles published between 1980 and 2021 was shared. According to analysis results to determine trend topics, the keywords studied in recent years include return to sport, ACL injury, anterolateral ligament, pivot shift, quadriceps strength, KOOS, ACL tear, ACL repair, meniscal repair, knee ligaments, tibial slope, posterior tibial slope, return to play, adolescent, graft failure and lateral meniscus.</jats:p>

TI  - Reconstruction of chronic anterior cruciate ligament rupture using the ligament advanced reinforcement system artificial ligament-comparisons between patients over 50 years and under 50 years.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">With the increasing physical activity level in elderly population, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are becoming more frequent. Due to the possible surgery complications, treatment for ACL rupture in patients with advanced age is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to compare the therapeutic effects of reconstruction using the ligament advanced reinforcement system (LARS) artificial ligament in patients older than 50 and patients younger than 50 with chronic ACL rupture.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Indications included: (I) concurrent history of subjective symptomatic anterior knee instability despite nonoperative rehabilitation for least 3 months, (II) positive preoperative Lachman and pivot shift tests, (III) ACL stump still connecting the femur with the tibia as demonstrated by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and (IV) some residual ligament fibers still connecting the femur with the tibia as demonstrated by arthroscopy. Participants were divided into groups based on their age. Participants were divided into groups based on their age. A total of 37 patients who underwent reconstruction of chronic ACL rupture using the LARS artificial ligament were divided into group A (≥50 years, n=16) and group B (&lt;50 years, n=21).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The outcome measures were compared between the 2 groups. These included the baseline clinical data, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring system, Pivot shift test, Lachman test, Kneelax arthrometer measurements, Tegner activity scale, Lysholm knee scoring scale, and Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic classification of arthritis and complications. Postoperative knee laxity and the functional examination were significantly improved compared to preoperative measurements for both groups (all P&lt;0.01). No significant differences were found in postoperative knee laxity and functional examination between the 2 groups (all P&gt;0.05). The level of osteoarthritis did not statistically increase in either group during follow-up (all P&gt;0.05). No complications associated with the arthroscopic surgery were found in either group.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusions" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The reconstruction of chronic ACL rupture using the LARS artificial ligament showed similar therapeutic effects in patients over the age of 50 and those under the age of 50.</AbstractText>

TI  - Returning to sport after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in amateur sports men: a retrospective study.
PY  - 2016
AB  - BACKGROUND According to the literature, 95% of professional athletes return to their sport after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. The main objective of this study was to verify the return to sport after ACL reconstruction in a homogenous group of amateur sportsmen and sportswomen in a series of Italian patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS We designed a retrospective study in which we analyzed the amateur sports patients operated for ACL reconstruction. We verified whether they had returned to sporting activities by comparing the pre- and post-operative Tegner activity scores. We then analyzed the average time to restart the sporting activity and the Lysholm and International Knee Documenting Committee (IKDC) scores. RESULTS We analyzed 80 subjects: 47.5% restarted a sports activity, on average after eight months, with a significant reduction of their competitive level or physical commitment, as expressed by the Tegner activity score (pre-operative: 6.9; post-operative: 3.9; p<0.01). The functional knee recovery was good, as expressed by the average score of the Lyshom Knee Scoring Scale (93.5) and the IKDC (74.7). CONCLUSIONS In the literature, a return to sport for international case studies and amateur sports is higher than our data. In our population we found the lack of information provided by the medical staff at discharge and follow-up. The assessment at a short-term follow up allowed us to verify that at the end of the post-surgical rehabilitation program the patients were uninformed about the timing and the ability to resume a sporting activity. An efficacious relationship between orthopedic doctor, physiotherapist and a doctor in motorial science may ensure proper treatment the patient after ACL reconstruction. It is important to guarantee the restarting of the sports activity to have a better quality of life in amateur sports. Level of evidence: V.

TI  - Loss of chondroprotection of medial collagen meniscus implant (CMI) at 20-year follow-up.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The mid-term results of the collagen meniscus implant (CMI) procedure for the replacement of partial meniscus defects have already been described. However, there is a paucity of long-term comparative studies. This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes, failures, and osteoarthritis progression of patients who underwent partial medial meniscectomy and medial CMI implantation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Thirty-six nonconsecutive patients with medial meniscus injuries that underwent medial CMI (MCMI) implantation or partial medial meniscectomy (PMM) between 1997 and 2000 were included in a prospective study with an intermediate 10-year follow-up examination and a final follow-up examination at 20-year follow-up. Outcome measures at the 20-year follow-up included the Lysholm score, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee form , and Tegner activity level. Bilateral weight-bearing radiographs were also performed to evaluate hip-knee-angle (HKA) and the medial joint line height (JL). Data regarding complications and failures were also collected.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">At the 20-year follow-up, 31 patients (83% follow-up rate) with a mean age of 60.7 ​± ​8.9 years were included in the final analysis (21.1 ​± ​1.2 years follow-up). Four reoperations and one failure per group were reported. When comparing the clinical results of the two groups, no difference was found considering the Lysholm score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner, and the IKDC. Moreover, 20 patients underwent radiographic examination (10 MCMI, 10 ​MM), and no statistically significant difference was reported concerning the JL, HKA, and the presence and incidence of osteoarthritis between the two groups.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The CMI implant for partial medial meniscectomy provided good long-term results and a low failure rate. However, differently from the 10 years follow-up, the clinical and the radiological outcomes were not superior compared to the medial meniscectomy group. The present study's result suggests that using a medial scaffold is not chondroprotective.</AbstractText>

TI  - Four Distinct 5-Year Trajectories of Knee Function Emerge in Patients Who Followed the Delaware-Oslo ACL Cohort Treatment Algorithm.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Impairments and dysfunction vary considerably after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, and distinct subgroups may exist.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">(1) To identify subgroups of patients with ACL injury who share common trajectories of patient-reported knee function from initial presentation to 5 years after a treatment algorithm where they chose either ACL reconstruction (ACLR) plus rehabilitation or rehabilitation alone. (2) To assess associations with trajectory affiliation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">We included 276 patients with a acute first-time complete unilateral ACL injury. All patients underwent a 5-week neuromuscular and strength training program before a shared decision-making process about treatment. Within their latest attended follow-up, 62% of patients had undergone early ACLR (&lt;6 months after the 5-week program), 11% delayed ACLR (&gt;6 months after the 5-week program), and 27% progressive rehabilitation alone. Patients completed the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) at inclusion, after the 5-week program, and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years after ACLR or completion of the 5-week program (patients treated with rehabilitation alone). We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify trajectories of IKDC-SKF and multinomial logistic regression to assess associations with trajectory affiliation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Four distinct trajectories of IKDC-SKF were identified: Low (n = 22; 8.0% of the cohort), Moderate (n = 142; 51.4%), High (n = 105; 38.0%), and High Before Declining (n = 7; 2.5%). The High trajectory had higher scores at inclusion than the Moderate trajectory, but both improved considerably within 1 year and had thereafter stable high scores. The High Before Declining trajectory also started relatively high and improved considerably within 1 year but experienced a large deterioration between 2 and 5 years. The Low trajectory started low and had minimal improvement. New knee injuries were important characteristics of the High Before Declining trajectory, concomitant meniscal injuries were significantly associated with following the Low (vs Moderate) trajectory, and early/preoperative quadriceps strength and hop symmetry (measured at inclusion) were significantly associated with following the High (vs Moderate) trajectory.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">We identified 4 distinct 5-year trajectories of patient-reported knee function, indicating 4 subgroups of patients with ACL injury. Importantly, 88% of the patients who followed our treatment algorithm followed the Moderate and High trajectories characterized by good improvement and high scores. Due to eligibility criteria and procedures in our cohort, we can only generalize our model to athletes without major concomitant injuries who follow a similar treatment algorithm. Concomitant meniscal injuries and new knee injuries were important factors in the unfavorable Low and High Before Declining trajectories. These associations were exploratory but support the trajectories' validity. Our findings can contribute to patient education about prognosis and underpin the importance of continued secondary injury prevention.</AbstractText>

TI  - Effects of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury on postural control and muscle activity of head, neck and trunk muscles
PY  - 2006
AB  - SUMMARY The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects that an anterior cruciate ligament injury of the knee has on postural control and activity of neck, head and trunk muscles to investigate the existence of connections between the masticatory system and body posture. Surface electromyographic activity of the muscles at mandibular rest position, and during maximal voluntary clenching and posturometric and stabilometric measurements of 25 adult patients having pathology on the left knee were compared with a control non-pathological group. At rest, the patients showed a higher muscular activity of anterior temporalis, masseter, sternocleidomastoid and lower trapezius, compared with the control subjects (P <0 AE05). At maximal voluntary clenching, the patients showed a lower muscular activity of the right anterior temporalis and masseter and a higher muscular activity of the lower trapezius, compared with the control subjects. For the stabilometric measurements, all the subjects showed a significant reduction in the postural centre of pressure path length during the test with eyes open and cotton rolls, compared with the test with eyes closed and mandibular rest position (P <0 AE05). In addition, the patients showed a significant displacement of the postural centre of pressure in a forward direction (P <0 AE05) and into the right side (P <0 AE05), compared with the control subjects. Anterior cruciate ligament injury appears to be associated to a change in the activity of head, neck and trunk muscles and to a change in the position of the postural centre of pressure. Cotton rolls seem to improve the stability of the subject.

TI  - Development of the IKDC Forms
PY  - 2016
AB  - The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) was formed under the auspices of The American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine and The European Society of Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy in 1987 to develop a standardized international documentation system to evaluate treatment for acute ACL injuries. It was anticipated that the IKDC Knee Evaluation Form would serve as a foundation for a more comprehensive evaluation system, allowing for valid scientific analysis of knee function. The first step was to agree on standard terminology to document motion and function. Next, clinical examination of the limits of knee motion was critiqued, and core measurements were adopted.

TI  - Arthroscopic suture fixation of tibial eminence avulsion fractures.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Purpose This study presents the clinical results of a procedure for treating tibial eminence fractures of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) using arthroscopic reduction and No. 5 Ethibond sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). Methods This prospective study analyzed 36 patients who underwent arthroscopic reduction and suture fixation for image-proven ACL avulsion fractures of the tibial eminence. The classification of Meyers and McKeever identified 6 type II, 16 type III, and 14 type IV fractures. The mean follow-up period was 34.4 months (range, 24 to 91 months). Follow-up assessment included Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) and radiographic evaluation. Results The mean preoperative Lysholm score in the 36 knees was 38 (range, 28 to 54); the mean postoperative Lysholm score was 98 (range, 83 to 100). The mean preinjury and preoperative Tegner scores in the 36 knees were 7.5 ± 1.5 (range, 5 to 9) and 3 ± 1.7 (range, 2 to 5), respectively. The mean postoperative Tegner score was 7.3 ± 1.7 (range, 5 to 9). At final follow-up, 34 patients (94.5%) were classified by IKDC score as normal or nearly normal (grade A or B). The IKDC classification was abnormal (grade C) in 2 patients (5.5%). All 36 fractures achieved union within 3 months. No significant complications, such as arthrofibrosis, loss of initial fixation, or wound infection, were noted. Conclusions Treating ACL avulsion fracture by arthroscopic suture fixation by use of 4 No. 5 Ethibond sutures can restore ACL length, stabilize fragments, promote early motion, and minimize morbidity. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Autologous Dual-Tissue Transplantation for Osteochondral Repair: Early Clinical and Radiological Results
PY  - 2015
AB  - BackgroundNumerous treatment methods for osteochondral repair have been implemented, including auto- and allogeneic osteochondral transplantations, combined bone and chondrocyte transplantations, and synthetic implants, but no gold standard treatment has been established. We present preliminary data on a combined autologous bone and cartilage chips: autologous dual-tissue transplantation (ADTT); an easily applicable, low-cost treatment option for osteochondral repair. The aim of this study was to investigate the early biological and clinical outcome of ADTT.MaterialsEight patients (age 32 ± 7.5 years) suffering from osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) in the knee were enrolled. The OCD lesion was debrided and the osteochondral defect was filled with autologous bone, to a level at the base of the adjacent cartilage. Cartilage biopsies from the intercondylar notch were chipped and embedded within fibrin glue in the defect. Evaluation was performed using magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and clini...

TI  - Reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament by using two different techniques
PY  - 2010
AB  - Introduction. Modern literature concerning reconstructions of Anterior
 Cruciate Ligament is mostly focused on the choice of graft (hamstring or
 bone-tendon-bone), its placing, tensioning and fixation. The
 bone-hamstring-bone graft consists of compressed cancellous bone on its ends
 and it has been developed to achieve a more rigid fixation of the graft. The
 aim of this study was to compare the postoperative results in surgically
 treated patients two years after the reconstruction of anterior cruciate
 ligament. Material and methods. The study included 55 patients divided into
 two groups according to the implanted graft: bone-tendon-bone and
 bone-hamstring-bone graft. The results were assessed by Tegner and Lysholm
 scoring systems, arthrometric measurements, functional tests and
 International Knee Documentation Committee standard. Results. The average
 postoperative results did not show a statistically significant difference
 (p<0.05) between the two groups (94 in the bone-tendon-bone group versus 93
 in the bone-hamstring-bone group) according to Lysholm scoring system, nor in
 the arthrometric measurements obtained by Lachman test (2.0:2.1). According
 to the International Knee Documentation Committee standard, the
 bone-hamstring-bone group had more excellent results, but also three
 unsatisfactory ones; so, the bone-tendon-bone group was found to have uniform
 and better results (100% of excellent and good results vs. 91% in the
 bone-hamstring-bone group). Better results were also recorded by Tegner
 scoring system in the bone-tendon-bone group (8.6 vs. 7.1) due to the fact
 that there were more active athletes and greater preoperative level of
 activities in this group (3.1 vs.7.l in the bone-hamstring group).
 Conclusions. The choice of graft is a less important factor in the
 reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament than its placing, tensioning and
 fixation, because a significant difference between groups was recorded only
 by the International Knee Documentation Committee standard.

TI  - Double-bundle versus single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in preventing the progression of osteoarthritis: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">The knee has a high incidence of osteoarthritis (OA) following the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, which was reduced by ACL reconstruction including double-bundle (DB) techniques and single-bundle (SB) techniques. However, the effectiveness of preventing the progression of OA after the ACL reconstruction using DB and SB techniques is controversial.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This meta-analysis was performed following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. The databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, were searched. Randomized controlled trials comparing DB with SB ACL reconstruction and reporting clinical outcomes of radiological OA were included. Quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. The outcome was analyzed using the risk ratio (RR) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Ten Randomized controlled trials studies were included in this meta-analysis (accounting 1062 knees: 475 SB and 587 DB). The rate of radiological OA after the ACL reconstruction was 39% in SB group and 34% in DB group. The results of meta-analysis showed no difference in the occurrence of radiological OA between DB group and in SB group (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.85-1.30, P = .63), including subgroup of radiological scores of OA (subgroup of Minimal OA: RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.61-1.48; P = .82; subgroup of Notable OA: RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.75-1.78; P = .51), subgroup of follow-up time in 5 years and more than 5 years (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.80-1.20; P = .85), and subgroup of autograft graft for ACL (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.79-1.19; P = .77). However, the DB group had less incidences of knee OA than the SB group in subgroup of less than 5 years (RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.13-1.92; P = .004) and subgroup of allograft type (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.06-1.91; P = .02).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Overall, this meta-analysis showed that the DB technique was no more effective in preventing the progression of OA than the SB technique in ACL reconstruction at midterm follow-up.</AbstractText>

TI  - Reconstruction for chronic grade-II posterior cruciate ligament deficiency in Malaysian military personnel
PY  - 2014
AB  - PURPOSE. To evaluate the outcome of reconstruction for chronic grade-II posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) deficiency in Malaysian military personnel. METHODS. Medical records of 16 male military personnel aged 25 to 41 years who underwent reconstruction for chronic grade-II PCL deficiency using the quadruple hamstrings tendon by a single surgeon were reviewed. The mean time from injury to surgery was 43.6 (range, 3-104) months. 10 patients had grade-I (n=4), grade-III (n=2), and grade-IV (n=4) lesions of the medial femoral condyles. Seven patients had medial (n=6) and lateral (n=1) meniscus tears. At the 2-year follow-up, patients were asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of the Lysholm score, Tegner activity level, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form. Posterior drawer test, KT-2000 arthrometer test for posterior translation of the tibia, and military health grade (MHG) were assessed by an independent assessor. RESULTS. At the 2-year follow-up, the mean Lysholm score was 83; the score was excellent in 2 patients, good in 9, fair in 4, and poor in one. The mean IKDC subjective score was 74. The median Tegner activity level increased from 5.5 to 6. The posterior drawer test of 11 patients improved to grade I and the remaining 5 remained at grade II. The mean posterior translation of the tibia was 2.4 mm postoperatively; the posterior translation was normal in 8 patients, nearly normal in 7, and abnormal (≥6 mm) in one. The MHG improved in 14 patients and remained unchanged in 2. The latter 2 patients had no chondral lesion or meniscus injury. The first one was 40 years old with a postoperative IKDC score of 55 and a Tegner activity level of 2. The second one was 34 years old with a postoperative IKDC score of 65 and posterior translation of the tibia of 6 mm. CONCLUSION. Surgical reconstruction for chronic grade-II PCL injury achieved satisfactory outcome and may be appropriate for military personnel.

          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Seventy-eight knees in 74 patients, with a median age of 15.3 years (interquartile range: 14.4, 16.1), were included. Forty-five knees underwent isolated MPFL reconstruction and 33 knees had a combined MPFL + TTO. The knees that underwent MPFL + TTO had significantly greater tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance (19.0 mm vs. 15.4 mm, P =0.015) and patellar tendon-lateral trochlear ridge distance (10.9 mm vs. 5.9 mm, P =0.018) than the knees treated with isolated MPFL reconstruction. Four knees (5.1%) underwent revision stabilization surgery, including 3 knees in the MPFL cohort (6.7%) and 1 knee in the MPFL + TTO cohort (3.0%). The rate of failure between the MPFL and MPFL + TTO knees was not significantly different, P =0.634. There were no differences in age, sex, body mass index, number of dislocations, or any imaging characteristics in patients who underwent revision versus those who did not. Patient-reported outcomes were collected on 50 knees at a median of 36 months (interquartile range: 24, 54) after surgery, and no differences were noted between cohorts.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Patellar stabilization surgery, including MPFL reconstruction and TTO in carefully selected patients, had excellent revision-free outcomes in 95% of this adolescent cohort. In this case series, those patients whose treatment included TTO had greater tibial tubercle-trochlear groove and patellar tendon-lateral trochlear ridge as compared to the isolated MPFL cohort. Despite previous literature suggesting demographic and imaging characteristics as risks for recurrent instability, we identified no characteristics within these two distinct surgical treatment groups to be predictive of the need for revision stabilization, regardless of the treatment group.</AbstractText>

TI  - ACL Reconstruction Using Quadrupled Semitendinosus Versus Double-Stranded Semitendinosus and Gracilis Autograft: 2-Year Results From a Prospective Randomized Controlled Study.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A disadvantage of using hamstring tendon autograft consisting of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is pain from tendon harvesting and persistent hamstring weakness. In the tendon-sparing all-inside technique, a quadrupled semitendinosus graft and adjustable-loop cortical fixation are suggested to give less postoperative flexion deficits while displaying overall similar clinical results to the traditional hamstring technique. However, there are a limited number of high-quality studies comparing these techniques with inconsistent results.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To investigate differences between the all-inside (quadrupled semitendinosus) and traditional hamstring (double-stranded semitendinosus and gracilis) technique regarding (1) self-reported function, (2) hamstring strength, and (3) knee laxity.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 98 patients were randomized to either the all-inside or the traditional hamstring technique. Perioperatively, duration of surgery and graft size were obtained. The International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 Subjective Knee Form score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Tegner Activity Scale score, knee laxity (KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference and pivot shift), range of motion, isokinetic knee strength, and hop test score were collected preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively. Return-to-sport readiness was evaluated 9 months postoperatively.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 89 patients completed 2-year follow-up, 45 patients with the all-inside technique and 44 patients with the traditional hamstring technique. There were no significant differences between groups in any of the outcome measures 2 years after surgery, but there was a tendency in the all-inside group toward having increased anterior translation (mean, 3.6 mm vs 2.7 mm), a higher number of revision surgeries (5 patients vs 2 patients), and more patients having +1 and +2 pivot-shift values (29 vs 18 patients) when compared with the traditional group.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The all-inside technique yields equivalent results to the traditional hamstring technique 2 years after surgery and should be considered a reliable technique to use for ACL reconstruction. Sparing the gracilis tendon does not lead to less persistent hamstring weakness. Long-term follow-up is needed to further determine whether the tendency of increased anterior translation seen at 2 years postoperatively will lead to a higher risk of graft failure.</AbstractText>

TI  - Altered Loading in the Injured Knee after ACL Rupture
PY  - 2012
AB  - Articular loading is an important factor in the joint degenerative process for individuals with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Evaluation of loading for a population that exhibits neuromuscular compensation for injury requires an approach which can incorporate individual muscle activation strategies in its estimation of muscle forces. The purpose of this study was to evaluate knee joint contact forces for patients with ACL deficiency using an EMG-driven modeling approach to estimate muscle forces. Thirty athletes with acute, unilateral ACL rupture underwent gait analysis after resolving range of motion, effusion, pain, and obvious gait impairments. Electromyography was recorded bilaterally from 14 lower extremity muscles and input to a musculoskeletal model for estimation of muscle forces and joint contact forces. Gait mechanics were consistent with previous reports for individuals with ACL-deficiency. Our major finding was that joint loading was altered in the injured limb after acute ACL injury; patients walked with decreased contact force on their injured knee compared to their uninjured knee. Both medial and lateral compartment forces were reduced without a significant change in the distribution of tibiofemoral load between compartments. This is the first study to estimate medial and lateral compartment contact forces in patients with acute ACL rupture using an approach which is sensitive to individual muscle activation patterns. Further work is needed to determine whether this early decreased loading of the injured limb is involved in the development of osteoarthritis in these patients.

TI  - Meniscal tears left in situ during anatomic single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2014
AB  - OBJECTIVES : Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are a common finding in sports medicine. Our scope is to investigate whether stable, incomplete medial meniscus tears could be left untreated during single bun - dle anatomic anterior cruciate ligament recon - struction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective ob - servational study on 597 knees from a single surgeon cohort, using the same reconstruction technique, found 23 medial and 48 lateral menis - cus tears which could be left untreated. RESULTS: None of the cases required reinter - vention during the first postoperative year. In fact, 21.7% of the medial meniscus group and 14.6% of the lateral group had potential residual symptoms that were not confirmed and gradual - ly disappeared within one year. A comparison of Cincinnati Knee, IKDC scores and limb symme - try index values (calculated using the triple hop for distance into the two groups) found no differ - ences for the last two variables (both p = 0.065) and was marginal for the first score ( p < 0.05). The between groups comparisons, performed in the KT-1000, also yielded no difference ( p = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: We than concluded that incom - plete meniscal tears, left in situ at the time of ante - rior cruciate ligament reconstruction, could have favorable outcomes as long as decisions are care - fully weighed with regard to the length of the le - sion. Also, at least in this perspective, anatomic single bundle has proved a sufficient stabilizer for anteriortranslationofthetibia.

TI  - Muscle Strength and Efficiency of Muscle Activities Recovery Using Single-Joint Type Hybrid Assistive Limb in Knee Rehabilitation after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Decreased muscle strength often occurs after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction; this can include muscle atrophy, neuromuscular dysfunction, and reduced force generation efficiency. Hybrid assistive limb (HAL) technology, which integrates an interactive biofeedback system connecting the musculoskeletal system to the brain and spinal motor nerves, offers a potential intervention. Our study, conducted from March 2018 to August 2023 using knee HAL single-joint technology, was a prospective non-randomized controlled trial involving 27 patients who had undergone arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. They were split into two groups: HAL (18 patients) and control (nine patients). Beginning 18 weeks after their surgery, the HAL group participated in three weekly sessions of knee HAL-assisted exercises. Both the HAL and control groups underwent isokinetic muscle strength tests at postoperative weeks 17 and 21. Testing utilized an isokinetic dynamometer at 60°/s, 180°/s, and 300°/s. The Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) was employed to measure side-to-side differences. The HAL group showed significant LSI improvements in peak extension torque across all testing velocities and for peak flexion torque at 60°/s and 300°/s. The rate of change in LSI for peak flexion torque at 300°/s was significantly higher post-measurements (<i>p</i> = 0.036; effect size = 1.089). The change rate for LSI in peak extension torque at 300°/s and all peak flexion torques showed medium to large effect sizes in Cohen's d. In conclusion, knee HAL single-joint training positively influenced muscle strength recovery and efficiency. The HAL training group exhibited superior muscle strength at various isokinetic testing velocities compared to the control group.

TI  - Graft failure and revision rate after ACL repair with dynamic intraligamentary stabilization. One-year results of a prospective case series of 155 patients.

Additionally, differences in functional outcome between patients with and without anteroposterior laxity were assessed. It was hypothesized that the failure rate of DIS was non-inferior to that of previously reported ACL reconstruction (10%).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">In this prospectively designed multicenter study, including patients with an acute ACL rupture, DIS was performed within 21 days after rupture. Primary outcome was failure of the graft at 1 year post surgery, defined as 1) re-rupture of the graft, 2) revision of DIS, or 3) a &gt; 3 mm side-to-side difference in anterior tibial translation compared to the non-operated knee (∆ATT), measured by the KT1000 device. Additional analysis was performed using a 5 mm threshold. The subjective International Knee Documentation Committee Score (IKDC) and Numerical Rating Scales (NRS) for pain and confidence were used to evaluate functional outcome.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 155 patients were included with a mean age at surgery of 27.8 years (SD 9.4). The mean interval from rupture to DIS was 16.4 days (SD 5.2). At a median follow-up of 13 months (IQR 12-18) the failure rate of the graft was 30.2% (95%CI:22.0-39.4); 11 patients (7%) required secondary reconstructive surgery and of the 105 patients who attended ATT measurement, 24 patients (23%) had an ∆ATT &gt; 3 mm. Secondary analysis, based on a 5 mm threshold, revealed a failure rate of 22.4% (95%CI: 15.2; 31.1). A total of 39 patients (25%) reported at least one complication, comprising mainly arthrofibrosis, traumatic re-rupture and pain. In these patients, removal of the monoblock was performed in 21 cases (13.5%). At follow-up no significant differences in functional outcomes between patients with ∆ATT &gt; 3 mm and stable ATT were observed.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">This prospective multicenter study found a high failure rate at one year follow-up of 30% (7% revision surgery and 23% &gt; 3 mm side-to-side difference in anterior tibial translation) in patients treated by primary repair of the ACL with DIS, and did therefore not demonstrate non-inferiority to ACL reconstruction. For patients who did not require secondary reconstructive surgery, this study found good functional outcomes, also in case of persistent anteroposterior knee laxity (∆ATT &gt; 3 mm).</AbstractText>

TI  - Predictors of knee joint loading after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2016
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury results in altered knee joint mechanics which frequently continue even after ACL reconstruction. The persistence of altered mechanical loading of the knee is of concern due to its likely role in the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA). Joint contact forces are associated with post-traumatic OA development, but evaluation of factors influencing the magnitude of contact forces after ACL injury is needed to advance current strategies aimed at preventing post-traumatic OA. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify predictive factors of knee joint contact forces after ACL reconstruction. Thirty athletes completed standard gait analysis with surface electromyography 6 months after ACL reconstruction. An electromyographic-driven musculoskeletal model was used to estimate joint contact forces. External knee adduction moment was a significant predictor of medial compartment contact forces in both limbs, while vertical ground reaction force and co-contraction only contributed significantly in the uninvolved limb. The large influence of the knee adduction moment on joint contact forces provides mechanistic clues to understanding the mechanical pathway of post-traumatic OA after ACL injury. Statement of Clinical Significance: This study provides critical information in improving the understanding of mechanisms influencing the development of post-traumatic OA after ACL injury. Further work is needed to identify additional driving factors of joint loading in the ACL-injured limb and develop treatment strategies to avert the deleterious consequences of post-traumatic OA. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Seventeen patients were available for the 24-month (final) follow-up (4 dropouts). Lysholm significantly improved from 48 preoperatively stepwise to 95 at final follow-up (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Tegner improvement from 2.5 at baseline to 4.0 at final follow-up was not significant (<i>P</i> = 1.0). MOCART score improved significantly and stepwise from 65 at 3 months to 90 at 24 months (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Total WORMS improved from 14.5 at surgery to 7.0 after 24 months (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).

SF volume and interleukin (IL)-6 concentrations in SF were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Synovitis was assessed histologically using a semiquantitative scoring system. Macrophage infiltration was assessed by immunohistochemistry using a semiquantitative score for F4/80 expression. The M1/M2 ratio was calculated using percentage of cells positive for CD80 and CD163. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines was assessed by the percentage of IL-1β- and IL-6-positive cells. The number of vascular endothelial growth factor-positive luminal structures was counted to assess angiogenesis. The change in each parameter was compared before and after AKO using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Twenty-four knees of 21 patients were included. SF volume and IL-6 concentration significantly decreased postoperatively (12.6 ± 2.1 mL vs 4.2 ± 0.6 mL; P &lt; .0001 and 50.5 ± 8.6 pg/mL vs 20.7 ± 3.8 pg/mL; P = .0001, respectively). A significant reduction in synovitis score (P = .0001), macrophage infiltration (P &lt; .0003), M1/M2 ratio (P &lt; .0007), angiogenesis (P &lt; .0001), and the percentage of IL-1β- and IL-6-positive cells in the intima (P &lt; .008 and P &lt; .002, respectively) was found after AKO.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">SF volume and IL-6 concentrations in the SF decreased and inflammatory synovium pathology improved after AKO. In addition to biomechanical changes, the biological environment of the joint can be improved after AKO.</AbstractText>

TI  - Factors Affecting Return to Sport After ACL Reconstruction
PY  - 2014
AB  - Athletes with an ACL injury commonly ask when they will be able to return to sport. The answer has always been ambiguous, ranging from a few weeks to a few months. Some athletes, even after ACL reconstruction and completion of the prescribed rehabilitation, are unable to resume their pre-injury activities. It is important to identify factors which will determine the athletes’ ability to return to sport. Standard knee scales are a valuable tool for evaluating the progression of knee recovery following ACL reconstruction. However, the psychological profile and motivation of the patient are also important.

TI  - Time Line for Noncopers to Pass Return-to-Sports Criteria After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2010
AB  - Study Design Randomized clinical trial. Objectives Determine effective interventions for improving readiness to return to sports post-operatively in patients with complete, unilateral, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture who do not compensate well after the injury (noncopers). Specifically, we compared the effects of 2 preoperative interventions on quadriceps strength and functional outcomes. Background The percentage of athletes who return to sports after ACL reconstruction varies considerably, possibly due to differential responses after acute ACL rupture and different management. Prognostic data for noncopers following ACL reconstruction is absent in the literature. Methods Forty noncopers were randomly assigned to receive either progressive quadriceps strength-training exercises (STR group) or perturbation training in conjunction with strength-training exercises (PERT group) for 10 preoperative rehabilitation sessions. Postoperative rehabilitation was similar between groups. Data on quadriceps st...

AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Multiligament reconstruction (MLR) has become the standard surgical approach for treating multiligament knee injuries (MLKIs).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Purpose" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To identify prognostic factors for patient-reported outcome measures, return to work (RTW), return to sports, and radiographic osteoarthritis (OA) (Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≥2) after MLR for MLKI.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Study Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Case-control study; Level of evidence 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Included were 52 consecutive patients (age, 35.5 ± 11 years; 75% men), with MLKI sustained between 2013 and 2019 and treated with MLR. At a mean follow-up of 3.8 ± 1.6 years, patient-reported outcome measure scores-including the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI), and the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey-RTW, return to sports, and weightbearing radiographs were obtained. A total of 20 determinants were hypothesized and tested by univariate logistic regression for binary variables or linear regression for continuous variables. Only factors identified as significant (<i>P</i> &lt; .10) were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The prevalence of injury severity according to the Schenck knee dislocation (KD) classification was as follows: KD I (44%), KD III (36%), KD IV (10%), and KD V (10%). Increased KD grades resulted in decreased IKDC (<i>P</i> = .002) and all 5 KOOS subscales (<i>P</i>≤ .007 for all) scores. Medial meniscectomy (23%) was associated with a worse ACL-RSI score (<i>P</i> = .007) and RTW failure (odds ratio [OR], 36.8; <i>P</i> = .035). Peroneal nerve palsy (6%) was associated with a worse ACL-RSI score (<i>P</i>≤ .001). Radiographic OA was observed in 38%, with distribution predominantly patellofemoral (80%) and medial tibiofemoral (45%). Traumatic cartilage damage (Outerbridge grade &gt;2 [37%]) was associated with secondary patellofemoral (OR, 10; <i>P</i> = .012) and medial tibiofemoral (OR, 10; <i>P</i> = .019) OA. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction failure (7%) was a risk factor for medial tibiofemoral OA (OR, 25.8; <i>P</i> = .006).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Increased Schenck KD grade, permanent peroneal nerve palsy, and irreparable medial meniscus lesions were prognostic factors for worse functional outcomes 3.8 years after MLKI was treated with MLR. Traumatic cartilage damage and anterior cruciate ligament failure were associated with the development of early OA.</AbstractText>

TI  - Reconstrucción artroscópica del ligamento cruzado anterior sin plastia intercondílea
PY  - 2002
AB  - Objective: The aim of the present study was to retrospectively analyze the intermediate-term results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction without notchplasty. Patients and methods: The study was based on 61 consecutive ACL reconstructions using an allograft from the central third of the patellar tendon and an arthroscopic monotunnel technique. The femoral tunnel was made in the isometric area and the tibial tunnel in the posterior part of the area of the ACL anatomic footprint. Knees with associated meniscal or chondral disease were excluded, as well as cases in which other ligaments were involved. Results: After an average follow-up of 6 years, manual testing of knee stability revealed a negative Lachman test and pivot-shift test in 69% and 91% of patients, respectively. The Genucom ® laxity test disclosed anterior and anterolateral translations of less than 5 mm in 57 (93%) and 59 (98%) of cases. According to the IKDC protocol, 59 knees were normal or almost normal. The average score of the Lysholm test was 91 points and of the Tegner activity scale, 6.9. Only two patients had postoperative extension deficits, due to arthrofibrosis and cyclops syndrome, respectively, which responded well to surgery. No degenerative radiological changes were detected. Conclusions: The results suggest that this type of reconstruction achieves satisfactory intermediate-term stability with a low rate of complications.

TI  - Anatomic Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using an Outside-in Technique: Two- to Six-Year Clinical and Radiological Follow-up.
PY  - 2015
AB  - PURPOSE We evaluated the clinical and radiological outcomes of double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using an outside-in technique with a follow-up of two- to six-years, especially in terms of the sports activity level and radiological degeneration. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-seven patients who were available for a minimum two-year follow-up after double-bundle ACL reconstruction using an outside-in technique were retrospectively evaluated. The mean follow-up period was 43.7 months. The knee function and stability were evaluated before the operation, one year after the operation (short-term follow-up), and more than two years after the operation (last follow-up). RESULTS Regarding the knee function, the Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation, and hop test showed significant improvement. Regarding the stability, the Lachman test, pivot shift test, KT-2000 arthrometer data, and anterior drawer radiographs using Telos showed significant improvement. Regarding the sports activity level, the patients who returned to pre-injury level activity was 68.7% according to the Tegner activity score and 76.1% according to the Cincinnati sports activity scale score. The incidence of aggravated degeneration or development of greater than IKDC grade A degeneration after surgery was 10.4%. CONCLUSIONS Double-bundle ACL reconstruction using an outside-in technique showed favorable clinical and radiological outcomes with respect to the knee function and stability, joint degeneraion, and, especially, return to pre-injury sports activity.

TI  - Effect of a Partial Superficial and Deep Medial Collateral Ligament Injury on Knee Joint Laxity.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Injuries to the medial collateral ligament (MCL), specifically the deep MCL (dMCL) and superficial MCL (sMCL), are both reported to be factors in anteromedial rotatory instability (AMRI); however, a partial sMCL (psMCL) injury is often present, the effect of which on AMRI is unknown.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To investigate the effect of a dMCL injury with or without a psMCL injury on knee joint laxity.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Controlled laboratory study.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Sixteen fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees were tested using a 6 degrees of freedom robotic simulator. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) was cut first and last in protocols 1 and 2, respectively. The dMCL was cut completely, followed by an intermediary psMCL injury state before the sMCL was completely sectioned. Tibiofemoral kinematics were measured at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion for the following measurements: 8 N·m of valgus rotation (VR), 4 N·m of external tibial rotation, 4 N·m of internal tibial rotation, and combined 89 N of anterior tibial translation and 4 N·m of external tibial rotation for both anteromedial rotation (AMR) and anteromedial translation. The differences between subsequent states, as well as differences with respect to the intact state, were analyzed.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">In an ACL-intact or -deficient joint, a combined dMCL and psMCL injury increased external tibial rotation and VR compared with the intact state at all angles. A significant increase in AMR was seen in the ACL-intact knee after this combined injury. Cutting the dMCL alone showed lower mean increases in AMR compared with the psMCL injury, which were significant only when the ACL was intact in knee flexion. Moreover, cutting the dMCL had no effect on VR. The ACL was the most important structure in controlling anteromedial translation, followed by the psMCL or dMCL depending on the knee flexion angle.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A dMCL injury alone may produce a small increase in AMRI but not in VR. A combined dMCL and psMCL injury caused an increase in AMRI and VR.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CLINICAL RELEVANCE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">In clinical practice, if an increase in AMRI at 30° and 90° of knee flexion is seen together with some increase in VR, a combined dMCL and psMCL injury should be suspected.</AbstractText>

TI  - NON-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT INJURIES IN THE GENERAL POPULATION
PY  - 1996
AB  - The operative treatment of lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in athletes has been widely advocated and performed. We have investigated the outcome of non-operative management in a lower-demand, general population. We reviewed a consecutive group of 228 patients, which excluded professional and high-level athletes, for two to 12 years after an ACL lesion had been diagnosed by arthroscopy. There was a low incidence of secondary ACL and meniscal surgery, 5.4% and 3.5% respectively, and all these procedures were performed during the first three years after the ACL injury. We studied a subgroup of 109 patients with follow-up of at least five years (mean 8.5 years) and evaluated them using the IKDC score. The general outcome was reasonably satisfactory, with 23% in grade A, 50% in grade B, 21% in grade C and only 6.4% in grade D. We found no statistically significant prognostic effect within this group as regards age, activity levels, or the incidence of associated lesions.

PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Tibial avulsion fractures of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) are challenging to treat and compromise knee stability and function. Traditional open surgery often requires extensive soft tissue dissection, which may increase the risk of morbidity. In response to these concerns, arthroscopic techniques have been evolving. The aim of this study was to introduce a modified arthroscopic technique utilizing an M-shaped suture fixation method for the treatment of tibial avulsion fractures of the PCL and to evaluate its outcomes through a case series.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="AIM" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To evaluate the effects of arthroscopic M-shaped suture fixation on treating tibia avulsion fractures of the PCL.</AbstractText>

TI  - Simultaneous medial closing wedge distal femoral varus osteotomy and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in the symptomatic femoral valgus deformity: A case report.
PY  - 2024
AB  - Distal femoral varus osteotomy (DFVO) is a widely recognized surgical procedure used to address valgus malalignment in patients with knee joint disorders. However, it still remains unclear whether anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction can be performed in a single procedure along with DFVO. Herein, we present a 73-year-old female patient who developed lateral osteoarthritis of the knee with valgus alignment due to chronic ACL deficiency following a twisting injury during skiing. She was physiologically very active, and strongly demanded to return to sports. We performed a combined procedure involving a medial closing wedge DFVO using an anatomical locking plate, along with double-bundle ACL reconstruction. The postoperative radiograph confirmed successful correction of knee alignment, specifically achieving varus alignment with precise conformance of the anatomical plate to the medial contour of the distal femur following the osteotomy. The patient resumed her previous sports activities without experiencing knee pain. The operated knee demonstrated restored anterior stability, as indicated by negative Lachman test results, and regained full range of motion. Both the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and the 2011 Knee Society score demonstrated continuous postoperative improvements over the three-year follow-up period, indicating positive functional outcomes and joint preservation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of medial closing wedge DFVO with anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction in the symptomatic femoral valgus deformity with chronic ACL deficiency in the literature.

TI  - Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)--validation of a Swedish version.
PY  - 1998
AB  - The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a self-administered instrument measuring outcome after knee injury at impairment, disability, and handicap level in five subscales. Reliability, validity, and responsiveness of a Swedish version was assessed in 142 patients who underwent arthroscopy because of injury to the menisci, anterior cruciate ligament, or cartilage of the knee. The clinimetric properties were found to be good and comparable to the American version of the KOOS. Comparison to the Short Form-36 and the Lysholm knee scoring scale revealed expected correlations and construct validity. Item by item, symptoms and functional limitations were compared between diagnostic groups. High responsiveness was found three months after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for all subscales but Activities of Daily Living.

TI  - Computer-assisted evaluation of kinematics of the two bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament.
PY  - 2007
AB  - The aim of this cadaveric study was to describe the kinematics of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-intact, posterolateral (PL) bundle-deficient and ACL-deficient knee by applying a protocol for computer-assisted evaluation of knee kinematics. The hypothesis that the PL bundle functions mainly at low knee flexion angles was tested. An optical tracking system was used to acquire knee joint motion on 10 knees during clinical evaluations by tracking markers rigidly attached to the bones. The protocol included acquisition of anterior-posterior (AP) translations and internal-external (IE) rotations, and evaluation of three clinical knee laxity tests (anterior drawer, manual and instrumented Lachman). The data demonstrated no significant contribution to AP translation and IE laxity from the PL bundle over the entire range of motion. The clinical knee laxity tests showed no significant differences between the ACL-intact and PL bundle-deficient states. The hypothesis could not be proven. Current clinical knee laxity measurements may not be suited for detecting subtle changes such as PL bundle deficiency in the ACL anatomy. The computation of knee laxity might be a step towards a more precise kinematic test of knee stability not only in the native and torn ACL state of the knee but also in the reconstructed knee.

TI  - Original Article With Video Illustrations Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Versus Hamstring Tendon: A Prospective Comparative Study With 9-Year Follow-Up
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose: To analyze the long-term evaluation of clinical, functional, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results after implant-free press-fit anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with bone‐patella tendon (BPT) versus quadrupled hamstring tendon (HT) grafts. Methods: Sixtytwo ACL-insufficient patients were included in a prospective, randomized study (31 BPT and 31 HT). Both surgical procedures were performed without any implants by a press-fit technique by the senior author. The femoral tunnel was drilled through the anteromedial portal for anatomic placement. At 8.8 years after reconstruction, 53 patients (28 BPT and 25 HT) were examined by different clinical and functional tests. Bilateral MRI scans were performed and interpreted by an independent radiologist. Results: On follow-up, the score on the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form was significantly better in the HT group. The clinical examination including range of motion, KT-1000 test (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and pivot-shift test showed no significant differences. On isokinetic testing, the mean quadriceps strength was close to normal (96%) in both groups, but the hamstring strength was lower in the HT group (100.3%/95.1%). Kneeling (1.5/1.1, P .002), knee walking (1.72/1.14, P .002), and single-leg hop test (95.8%/99.1%, P .057) were better in the HT group. The MRI findings about the mean degree of cartilage lesion (International Cartilage Repair Society protocol) of the operated (2.1/2.1) and nonoperated (1.4/1.8) knee showed no significant differences. No significant difference was found in the grade of medial or lateral meniscal lesion or the number of patients having meniscal lesions when the operated and nonoperated knees were compared. Tunnel measurements, Caton-Deschamps Index, and the sagittal ACL angle were similar. Conclusions: The implant-free press-fit technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by use of bone‐patellar tendon and hamstring grafts with anatomic graft placement is an innovative technique to preserve the cartilage and meniscal status without significant differences between the operated and nonoperated knees in the long term. Significantly less anterior knee pain was noted in the hamstring group, when testing for kneeling and knee walking. Level of Evidence: Level II, prospective comparative study.

TI  - Decrease in anterior knee laxity by electrical stimulation of normal and reconstructed anterior cruciate ligaments
PY  - 2006
AB  - We have investigated the changes in anterior laxity of the knee in response to direct electrical stimulation of eight normal and 45 reconstructed anterior cruciate ligaments (ACLs). In the latter, the mean time from reconstruction was 26.7 months (24 to 32). The ACL was stimulated electrically using a bipolar electrode probe during arthroscopy. Anterior laxity was examined with the knee flexed at 20° under a force of 134 N applied anteriorly to the tibia using the KT-2000 knee arthrometer before, during and after electrical stimulation. Anterior tibial translation in eight normal and 17 ACL-reconstructed knees was significantly decreased during stimulation, compared with that before stimulation. In 28 knees with reconstruction of the ACL, in 22 of which the grafts were found to have detectable somatosensory evoked potentials during stimulation, anterior tibial translation was not decreased. These findings suggest that the ACL-hamstring reflex arc in normal knees may contribute to the functional stability and that this may not be fully restored after some reconstructions of the ACL.

TI  - Functional Results after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction using the bone-patella Tendon-bone Method
PY  - 2008
AB  - This study evaluates the outcome of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with arthroscopy using the bone‐patella tendon-bone method. We performed this procedure in 24 patients with the average age of 33.1 years (range: 17-51 years ) between 2004 and 2006. Sixteen of the 24 patients were available for evaluation using the Lysholm Knee Score and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) system. Based on the Lysholm score, there was a statistically significant improvement in knee function when comparing pre- and post-surgical scores (p<0.001). Using IKDC guidelines, a majority of the patients have regained near normal to normal knee function. We conclude that ACL reconstruction using the bone-patella tendon-bone method can provide good functional outcome based on objective and subjective assessments.

TI  - Lack of Bone-on-Bone Arthritis Is Not a Strict Contraindication for Mobile-Bearing Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a viable option for patients with symptomatic knee arthritis isolated to 1 compartment. Previous articles have suggested that mobile-bearing UKA should not be performed in patients without bone-on-bone arthritis. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes and survivorship of mobile-bearing UKA in patients with severe osteoarthritis with bone-on-bone contact and patients with severe osteoarthritis but without bone-on-bone contact. Methods We retrospectively reviewed a single surgeon's experience with medial compartment mobile-bearing UKA in 219 patients (271 knees) who underwent the procedure between 2007 and 2015. Anteroposterior and posteroanterior radiographs were reviewed, and arthritis was graded using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) grading system. Only patients with grade D (severe arthritis) were studied. Of the patients who had grade-D arthritis, there were 81 patients (94 knees) with bone-on-bone arthritis and 82 patients (91 knees) without bone-on-bone contact. Functional outcomes were assessed using the Knee Society pain and function scores. Survivorship free of revision in these 2 groups was determined using Kaplan-Meier curves at 8 years. Results There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age (p = 0.91), sex (p = 0.21), or body mass index (p = 0.63). At the time of the final follow-up, there was no significant difference in Knee Society pain scores (p = 0.59) or Knee Society function scores (p = 0.9) between the 2 groups. There were 5 revisions in the group with bone-on-bone contact and 2 revisions in the group without bone-on-bone contact. The survivorship free of revision at 8 years was 95% for the group with bone-on-bone contact and 98% for the group without bone-on-bone contact (p = 0.45). Conclusions Patients with severe knee arthritis (IKDC grade D) without bone-on-bone contact had similar outcomes of mobile-bearing UKA compared with patients with bone-on-bone contact. UKA is a safe and reliable option in patients with severe osteoarthritis who do not have bone-on-bone contact on preoperative radiographs and it should therefore not be considered a contraindication for mobile-bearing UKA as long as the patient's symptoms are severe enough to warrant surgical intervention. Level of evidence Prognostic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Influence of residual anterior laxity on functional outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION">Residual laxity can persist after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. This increased anterior translation can be measured with a knee arthrometer. Nevertheless, the measurement parameters and functional impact of this residual laxity are not well understood. The aims of this study were to (1) evaluate the effect of applying loads of 134N, 200N and 250N on the measured residual laxity after ACL reconstruction and (2) evaluate the prognostic ability of the various measurement parameters on the functional outcomes.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="HYPOTHESIS">After ACL reconstruction, the functional outcomes will be correlated to the postoperative residual laxity.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">We did a prospective study of 61 recreational athletes who underwent surgical reconstruction of their ACL with the Kenneth-Jones technique between 2016 and 2019. The mean age of these patients was 27±7 years, and most were men (75%). The side-to-side difference in laxity was measured pre- and postoperatively using the GNRB® arthrometer at three load levels: 134N, 200N and 250N. The functional outcomes were determined based on the return to sports and the KOOS, IKDC and ARPEGE scores. The mean follow-up was 30±10 months.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Half the patients had returned to sport at their pre-injury levels, while 25% had returned to a lower level and 25% had stopped doing any physical activity. At 134N, a 1-mm increase in side-to-side difference was associated with a 2-fold higher risk of not returning to sports (OR 2; 95% CI 1.22-3.23; p&lt;0.01). At 200N, a 1-mm increase in side-to-side difference was associated with a 50% higher probability of having a poor/fair ARPEGE score (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.05-2.02; p=0.02). At 200N, a 4-mm side-to-side difference was the prognostic threshold for failure to return to sports with a positive predictive value of 86% and specificity of 98%.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">This case series found a strong correlation between residual laxity and the functional outcomes after ACL reconstruction. A threshold of 4mm residual laxity evaluated on the GNRB® at 200N was predictive of adverse outcomes and failure to return to sports in our population of recreational athletes.</AbstractText>

TI  - Mid-Term Results following Traumatic Knee Joint Dislocation.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">Although treatment strategies of knee joint dislocations have evolved, there is still no consensus on the best method and timing. New therapeutic concepts suggest that early one-stage treatment, including suturing and bracing of the cruciate ligaments in acute knee joint dislocation, are leading to improved functional results. This study aimed to evaluate the midterm functional outcome following traumatic knee joint dislocation and to determine whether the outcome is influenced by the surgical management, patient habitus or concomitant injuries.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">In this retrospective single center study, 38 patients with acute Schenck type II to IV knee dislocations were treated over an eight-year period in a level I trauma center. At follow-up, various clinical scores, such as the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Score, Lysholm Score, and Tegner Activity Scale (TAS), and individual questions about rehabilitation and activity levels of 38 patients were evaluated.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Mean follow-up was 5.5 ± 2.7 years. The mean IKDC Score was 65.6 ± 15.7 points, the average Lysholm Score was 70.5 ± 16.4 points and the median TAS was 4 (0-7), resulting in a loss of activity of 2 (range 0-6) points. There was no significant difference between a one-stage treatment compared to a two-stage approach. Ligament reconstruction of the ACL in a two-stage approach was required in only 33.3%. Further operations (early and late) were performed in 37% of cases. Being overweight was associated with more complications and worse outcomes, and external fixation with arthrofibrosis.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Knee dislocation is a severe trauma that often leads to a prolonged loss of function and increased knee pain over years, affecting the patient's activity. Clinical outcome is influenced significantly by concomitant injuries. Severe cases with initial external fixation are associated with a higher risk of knee stiffness and should be considered during rehabilitation. Obese patients present a challenge due to higher complication rates and lower postoperative knee function.</AbstractText>

TI  - The Effect of Graft Fixation Angles on Anteroposterior and Rotational Knee Laxity in Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Evaluation Using Computerized Navigation
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: One of the main differences affecting outcome between single-bundle and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions may be graft fixation angles and initial force settings; however, there has been little research to investigate these effects in either technique.Hypothesis: Anteroposterior and rotational knee laxities will be less in double-bundle ACL reconstructions than single-bundle reconstructions, and different graft fixation angles affect knee kinematics and pivot-shift phenomenon in double-bundle ACL reconstructions.Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.Methods: Eleven patients who underwent double-bundle ACL reconstruction were included in this study. The anteromedial bundle (AMB) and the posterolateral bundle (PLB) were provisionally fixed to a graft tensioning system during surgery. The graft fixation settings were as follows: (1) AMB only at 20° (A20), (2) PLB only at 20° (P20), (3) AMB at 20° and PLB at 0° (A20P0), (4) AMB at 20° and PLB at 20° (A20P20), and (...

TI  - Thigh muscle co-contraction patterns in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, athletes and controls during a novel double-hop test.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Efficient neuromuscular coordination of the thigh muscles is crucial in maintaining dynamic knee stability and thus reducing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury/re-injury risk. This cross-sectional study measured electromyographic (EMG) thigh muscle co-contraction patterns during a novel one-leg double-hop test among individuals with ACL reconstruction (ACLR; n = 34), elite athletes (n = 22) and controls (n = 24). Participants performed a forward hop followed by a 45° unanticipated diagonal hop either in a medial (UMDH) or lateral direction (ULDH). Medial and lateral quadriceps and hamstrings EMG were recorded for one leg (injured/non-dominant). Quadriceps-to-Hamstring (Q:H) ratio, lateral and medial Q:H co-contraction indices (CCIs), and medial-to-lateral Q:H co-contraction ratio (CCR; a ratio of CCIs) were calculated for three phases (100 ms prior to landing, initial contact [IC] and deceleration phases) of landing. We found greater activity of the quadriceps than the hamstrings during the IC and deceleration phases of UMDH/ULDH across groups. However, higher co-contraction of medial rather than lateral thigh muscles during the deceleration phase of landing was found; if such co-contraction patterns cause knee adduction, a putative mechanism to decrease ACL injury risk, during the deceleration phase of landing across groups warrants further investigation.

TI  - PROMs in Sports Medicine
PY  - 2019
AB  - PROMs in sports medicine could be a useful tool to analyze the results of several sports injuries in athletes and sports practitioners, regardless of the involved anatomical site (the shoulder, hip, knee, foot, and ankle). Moreover, the athletic population has singular expectations and objectives, differing from the general and sedentary population. Therefore, PROMs could have a more significant role in sports, particularly when designed for this specific population, and the level of physical demand reported, the stress involved in sports practice due to competition level should be used as patient’s references. This chapter approaches different types of PROMs commonly used in orthopedics and also discusses the development of PROMs in sports medicine.

TI  - Anatomic repair and ligament bracing as an alternative treatment option for acute combined PCL injuries involving the posteromedial or posterolateral corner-results of a multicentre study.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Combined PCL injuries involving the posteromedial/-lateral corner (PMC/PLC) usually require surgical management. Literature shows controversy regarding the standards of treatment. Suture-augmented repair leads to excellent results in acute knee dislocations but has not been investigated clinically in combined PCL injuries. The purpose of this multicentre study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of this technique in acute combined PCL injuries.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="MATERIALS &amp; METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">N = 33 patients with acute combined PCL injuries involving the PMC/PLC were treated by one-stage suture repair with ligament bracing of the PCL and suture repair of the accompanying PMC/PLC injuries with/without ligament bracing or primary augmentation by semitendinosus autograft. Outcome was assessed by IKDC questionnaire, Lysholm Score, Tegner Activity Scale and KOOS. Additional PCL stress-radiography was performed.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">N = 31 patients with combined PCL injuries (female: male = 7:24; age 39.1 ± 13.8 years) with a follow-up of 16.8 ± 9.6 months were finally evaluated. 18 had PMC injuries, 13 PLC injuries. 32.2% presented with accompanying meniscal tears (70% medial meniscus). 19.4% showed cartilage injuries grade III-IV. Complications included one infection and four knee stiffnesses. Three had symptomatic postoperative instability, all affiliated to the PLC group. The IKDC was 69.8 ± 16.5, Lysholm score 85 ± 14.4 and KOOS 89.7 ± 8.1. Median loss of activity (Tegner) was 0.89 ± 1.31. Comparing PMC and PLC, all scores showed a tendency towards more favourable outcomes in the PMC group (n.s.). Stress-radiography showed an overall side-to-side difference of 3.7 ± 3.8 mm. Subgroup evaluation showed statistically significant better results (p = 0.035) of PMC (2.5 ± 1.5 mm) versus PLC (5.8 ± 5.6 mm).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">One-stage suture repair with ligament bracing is a viable technique for acute combined PCL injuries and predominantly leads to good and excellent clinical outcomes. Patients with PLC injuries show a tendency towards inferior outcomes and higher instability rates compared to PMC injuries. These results may help in therapy planning and counselling patients with these rare injury pattern.</AbstractText>

TI  - Quadriceps tendon vs hamstring autograft in primary ACL reconstruction - a comparative study with minimum two-year follow-up.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Recently there has been growing interest in the quadriceps tendon (QUAD) as a valid option for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLR). The aims of the study is to compare the outcomes achieved in anatomic ACLR involving QUAD vs. Hamstring (HT) autografts. A total of 52 consecutive patients underwent an ACLR, 25 patients with QUAD graft and 27 with HT graft. The same surgical technique, fixation method and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. The following parameters were evaluated: functional status (Lysholm, Tegner, subjective IKDC scores), joint stability (Lachman and pivot shift tests), surgical reoperation rate, complications, degree of satisfaction and return to previous level of activity. Descriptive statistics were analysed using the Student's t-test. Forty four patients were evaluated (20 QUAD, 24 HT), with a mean follow-up of 27.4 months. Two patients were re-operated in the QUAD group (including one ACL revision), and one patient in the HT group required an ACL revision. There were no significant differences between the two groups in postoperative scores: Lysholm (96.05 vs. 96.05), IKDC (86.2 vs. 91.2) and Tegner (6 vs. 5) scales. The percentage of negative Lachman and pivot shift tests was similar in the two groups (45% vs. 50% and 40% vs. 45.8%, respectively). There were no significant differences between the groups in the degree of satisfaction (95.8% vs. 80%, p = .16) or in the percentage who returned to their previous level of activity (62.5% vs. 45%, p = .17). The use of a QUAD graft in ACL reconstruction leads to similar clinical and functional outcomes to those obtained with HT.

TI  - Improvements in Thigh Strength Symmetry Are Modestly Correlated With Changes in Self-Reported Function After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2018
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">The association between quadriceps strength and functional outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is a focus of current research, while evaluations of hamstring strength are limited, despite the frequent use of hamstring autografts.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between changes in quadriceps and hamstring strength symmetry and self-reported outcomes before ACLR and at 12 and 24 weeks after surgery. We hypothesized that improvements in quadriceps and hamstring strength symmetry would be correlated with improvements in self-reported outcome measures within the first 6 months after ACLR.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="METHODS">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Thirty patients who underwent ACLR with a hamstring autograft were enrolled. Quadriceps and hamstring strength and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) values were assessed before and at 12 and 24 weeks after ACLR; limb symmetry indexes for strength were calculated at each time point. The Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to analyze changes in KOOS values over time. Spearman rank-order correlations were used to test the relationship between changes in strength and KOOS values between each time point.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Hamstring and quadriceps limb symmetry significantly increased with time (<i>P</i> ≤ .03). Fair correlations were observed between changes in the hamstring index and changes in the KOOS Symptoms subscore from before surgery to 12 weeks postoperatively (<i>r</i> = 0.48; <i>P</i> ≤ .05). Changes in the quadriceps index (QI) were moderately correlated with changes in the KOOS Sport/Recreation subscore (<i>r</i> = 0.60; <i>P</i> = .001), and fair correlations were seen between the QI and the KOOS Quality of Life subscore (<i>r</i> = 0.39; <i>P</i> ≤ .04) from preoperatively to 12 weeks after surgery. Moderate correlations were seen between the QI and the KOOS Sport/Recreation subscore (<i>r</i> = 0.57; <i>P</i> = .005) from 12 to 24 weeks after surgery.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Improvements in quadriceps and hamstring strength symmetry were modestly associated with improvements in athletes' perceived function in the first 6 months after ACLR. Specifically, improvements in hamstring symmetry were associated with improvements in knee symptoms within the first 12 weeks postoperatively, while improvements in quadriceps symmetry were associated with improvements in self-reported sport function throughout the first 6 months after ACLR. The restoration of strength symmetry within the first 6 months may be a critical component of rehabilitation aimed at maximizing function after ACLR. Further investigation is warranted to comprehensively evaluate whether the timing of strength gains predicts future function, including those who successfully return to their preinjury activity level after ACLR.</AbstractText>

TI  - Supervised Rehabilitation May Lead to Better Outcome than Home-Based Rehabilitation Up to 1 Year after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background and objectives: Previous studies consistently found no significant difference between supervised and home-based rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, the function of the nonoperative knee, hamstring strength at deep flexion, and neuromuscular control have been overlooked. This prospective observational study was performed to investigate the outcomes after ACLR in operative and nonoperative knees between supervised and home-based rehabilitations. Materials and Methods: After surgery, instructional videos demonstrating the rehabilitation process and exercises were provided for the home-based rehabilitation group. The supervised rehabilitation group visited our sports medicine center and physical therapists followed up all patients during the entire duration of the study. Isokinetic muscle strength and neuromuscular control (acceleration time (AT) and overall stability index (OSI)) of both operative and nonoperative knees, as well as patient-reported knee function (Lysholm score), were measured and compared between the two groups 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. Results: The supervised rehabilitation group showed higher muscle strength of hamstring and quadriceps in nonoperative knees at 6 months (hamstring, p = 0.033; quadriceps, p = 0.045) and higher hamstring strength in operative and nonoperative knees at 1 year (operative knees, p = 0.035; nonoperative knees, p = 0.010) than the home-based rehabilitation group. At 6 months and 1 year, OSIs in operative and nonoperative knees were significantly better in the supervised rehabilitation group than in the home-based rehabilitation group (operative knees, p < 0.001, p < 0.001; nonoperative knees, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, at 6 months and 1 year, respectively). At 1 year, the supervised rehabilitation group also demonstrated faster AT of the hamstrings (operative knees, p = 0.016; nonoperative knees, p = 0.036). Lysholm scores gradually improved in both groups over 1 year; however, the supervised rehabilitation group showed higher scores at 1 year (87.3 ± 5.8 vs. 75.6 ± 15.1, p = 0.016). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that supervised rehabilitation may offer additional benefits in improving muscle strength, neuromuscular control, and patient-reported knee function compared with home-based rehabilitation up to 1 year after ACLR.

TI  - Quantitative MRI Analysis of Patellofemoral Joint Cartilage Health 2 Years After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction and Lateral Extra-Articular Tenodesis.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The addition of an iliotibial band-based lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) has been shown to reduce failure rates. However, there are concerns as to the potential overconstraint of tibiofemoral kinematics that may increase the risk of cartilage degradation. To date, no clinical study has investigated the effect of LET on patellofemoral joint articular cartilage health.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="HYPOTHESIS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">It was hypothesized that at 2 years postoperatively, (1) the addition of LET at the time of ACLR would have no effect on cartilage health on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and (2) higher cartilage relaxation values would be associated with worse patient-reported and functional outcomes.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A subset of patients from the STABILITY 1 randomized controlled trial were included. All patients underwent primary ACLR with a hamstring autograft. Patients were randomized to either LET augmentation or not. Cartilage status in the patellofemoral joint between the ACLR group and ACLR+LET group was compared using 2-year postoperative quantitative MRI and the ACL osteoarthritis scores of both the surgical and the contralateral nonsurgical knees. Objective functional outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were attained.</AbstractText>

No significant differences were seen in the mean values (ms) for adjusted T1ρ/T2 relaxation times in the medial patella (47.8/42.2 vs 47.3/43.2), central patella (45.5/42.5 vs 44.1/42.7), lateral patella (48.2/43.5 vs 47.3/43.0), medial trochlea (54.7/50.9 vs 56.4/50.9), central trochlea (53.3/51.1 vs 53.1/52.0), and lateral trochlea (54.9/52.1 vs 53.9/52.6) between the ACLR and ACLR+LET groups. No difference in overall ACL osteoarthritis scores was observed (<i>P</i> = .99). An increase in medial patellar T2 relaxation times was associated with a decreasing International Knee Documentation Committee score (<i>P</i> = .046), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Symptoms subscale score (<i>P</i> = .01), and total KOOS (<i>P</i> = .01).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">There was no statistical difference in patellofemoral cartilage health between knees 2 years after primary ACLR with hamstring tendon autograft with or without LET. Statistically significant correlations were found between quantitative MRI relaxation times, functional outcome scores, and PROMs; however, the correlations were weak and the clinical significance is unknown.</AbstractText>

TI  - Prospective Evaluation of Patellar Tendon Graft Fixation in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Comparing Composite Bioabsorbable and Allograft Interference Screws
PY  - 2006
AB  - Purpose: Bioabsorbable interference screws have proved to be biologically safe and to provide adequate graft fixation. Metallic interference screws have therefore been continuously replaced over the years. However, degradation times are highly variable, and bony replacement of the screw does not always occur in human beings. Composite interference screws have recently been introduced to enhance bony integration. We evaluated 2 different composite interference screws and compared them with an allograft interference screw over a 2-year period after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with an autologous bone–patellar tendon–bone graft. Methods: Three groups of patients were prospectively evaluated. Poly-L-lactid acid/hydroxyapatite composite screws (BioRCI-HA; Smith & Nephew, Andover, MA) (group A), poly-L-lactid acid/β-tricalcium phosphate composite screws (Bilok; Atlantech, Radevormwald, Germany) (group B), or allograft interference screws (CorlS; Regeneration Technologies, Alachua, FL) (group C) were used for tibial fixation of a patellar tendon autograft in ACL reconstruction. Each group consisted of 20 patients (mean age, 32.2 ± 10.9 years in group A, 32.3 ± 10.6 years in group B, and 31.1 ± 6.6 years in group C) with no significant ( P Results: Screw breakage during insertion occurred in 2 cases (1 in group A and 1 in group B). There was no significant ( P Conclusions: All 3 screw types provided adequate graft fixation and were associated with excellent clinical results and no inflammatory response on MRI. Ultimately, a resorbable screw has to be replaced by bone to facilitate revision surgery. Formation of a sclerotic rim around the outline of the screw makes later bony replacement (group B) unlikely. After 24 months, complete bony integration had only taken place when allograft screws were used. Clinical Relevance: At 24 months, no advantage of composite screw materials over conventional bioabsorbable screws could be detected. If composite materials will be of any advantage with respect to bony replacement has to be observed with longer-term follow-up. The allograft bone screw was completely incorporated and replaced by cancellous bone after 24 months. Unfortunately, the screw's more complicated handling, higher cost, and limited availability impair the possibilities for its standard clinical use.

TI  - Manual and Device-Assisted Hamstring Autograft Tensioning Yield Similar Outcomes following ACL Reconstruction.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText>The optimal initial graft tension during ACL reconstruction is still a matter of debate. Manual tension is commonly applied to the graft during tibial fixation. However, this has been associated with a greater graft failure rate than that associated with device-assisted tensioning. This study aims to compare the clinical outcomes between the application of manual tension and the use of the ConMed Linvatec SE™ Graft Tensioning System during graft fixation while performing anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A prospective comparative study was conducted between September 2015 and May 2017. Sixty-four patients (mean age 29.3 years, range 14-45) with isolated ACL injuries (and who would be subjected to ACL reconstruction with a quadruple hamstring tendon graft) were divided into two groups. In Group A (<i>n</i> = 29), common tension was applied manually to both grafts. In Group B (<i>n</i> = 35), specific tension was applied to the grafts with the use of a tensioner device (ConMed Linvatec SE™ (Stress Equalization) Graft Tensioning System). A total of 60 N was applied to the semitendinosus, and 40 N was applied to the gracilis. Clinical outcomes were assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">There were no significant differences between the baseline demographic and clinical data among the patients of the two groups (all <i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). The patients were followed up for a minimum of 24 months (mean ± SD). There were no significant differences in the side-to-side anterior knee laxity, the IKDC, the Lysholm Knee, and the Tegner Activity Scale scores for up to 24 months after operation. The pivot shift test was negative in all cases, and no graft failure was reported at a 2-year follow-up.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">No significant differences were found with respect to postoperative anterior knee laxity, clinical outcomes, activity level, and patient satisfaction between the application of manual tension and the use of the graft-tensioning system during tibial fixation while performing anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction with a quadruple hamstring tendon graft. Further high-quality clinical studies are required to elucidate whether device-assisted tension is superior to manual tension.</AbstractText>

TI  - Treatment and outcome of anterior cruciate ligament injury: Truth or Consequences
PY  - 2007
AB  - The overall aim of the work presented in this thesis was to evaluate the incidence, outcome and consequences within the 1st year of acute ACL injury of the knee. The KANON-study, a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing surgical and non-surgical treatment after acute ACL injury, was initiated and some results are included in this thesis. 642 subjects with acute knee injury were assessed in order to include 121 subjects in this RCT. Subgroups of the subjects assessed in the KANON-study and a group of amateur soccer players (188) were assessed. The annual incidence of ACL injury was found to be 81 per 100 000 inhabitants aged 10-64 years. Possibly as many as 50% of those with an acute ACL tear are misdiagnosed at the clinical examination in the acute phase. More than every second (57%) acutely ACL injured knee had an associated cortical bone depression fracture and almost all had bone marrow lesions (BML) visualized on MRI. A strong independent relationship between cortical bone depression fractures and bone marrow lesion volumes (p<0.001) suggests that a high proportion of ACL injured knees suffer from extensive compressive trauma to the joint cartilage which may, in part, explain the high frequency of osteoarthritis following this injury. In amateur soccer players, older age, female gender and lower level of competition (division) were associated with worse self-reported physical activity level. Thus, we recommend a clear description of how activity level was administered as well as adjustment for these variables in reports using self-reported activity level as an outcome. Using state-of-the-art quantitative MRI technology, we assessed the first year development of joint fluid (JF), BML and cartilage morphometry. JF and BML volumes gradually decreased over the first year, although BML was still persistent in 62% of the knees after one year. One year after the ACL injury, a consistent reduction of cartilage volume, cartilage surface area and thickness was found in the trochlea femur, while an increase of cartilage volume and surface area was found in the central medial femur. Surgical ACL reconstruction was directly and significantly related to increased JF volume at 3 and 6 months, BML volume at 6 months, cartilage volume and area in central medial femur, and decreased cartilage surface area in trochlea femur at 1 year after injury.

TI  - Critical Evaluation of Different Scoring Systems of the Knee
PY  - 2002
AB  - SUMMARY Assessment of the natural history of various knee injuries and the effects of operative and nonoperative treatments requires validated outcome measures. We present and review various outcome measures for the knee, including subjective patient reporting systems, comprehensive patient and clinician instruments, and activity scales. The validated subjective scales we review here include the Lysholm score, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score, the Knee Outcome Survey, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Sports Knee Instrument, and the Quality of Life Measure. We also review the widely used comprehensive instruments, including the Cincinnati Knee Rating System, the International Knee Documentation Committee Knee Evaluation Form, and the Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Score. We present analysis of several patellofemoral instruments and activity scales, and present and discuss studies that have compared various knee outcome measures.

TI  - Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Level 1 Athletes: Factors Associated With Return to Play, Reinjury, and Knee Function at 5 Years of Follow-up.
PY  - 2025
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Favorable outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) are often gauged by successful return to play (RTP), a low incidence of subsequent ACL injury, and positive patient-reported outcomes. Level 1 sports place the highest demands on the knee by requiring frequent pivoting, changes in direction, and jumping.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To analyze the outcomes of primary ACLR in level 1 athletes and identify pre- and intraoperative factors associated with RTP, ipsilateral ACL reinjury, contralateral ACL injury, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 5 years postoperatively.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A consecutive cohort of 1432 patients who underwent primary ACLR by 2 orthopaedic surgeons were prospectively evaluated. The RTP rate, incidence of ipsilateral/contralateral ACL injury, and IKDC score were analyzed at 5 years. Comparative analysis of clinical variables was performed between those who achieved favorable outcomes and those who did not. Outcomes at 5 and 2 years were also compared.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The mean age was 24.3 ± 7.3 years (males: 75%, females: 25%). Gaelic football was the predominant sport (40%), followed by soccer (19%). The RTP rate was 87.4%, with 59.8% of athletes still playing at an equivalent or higher level at 5 years. The incidence of ipsilateral reinjury for athletes who resumed level 1 sport was 4.3% for bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autografts with screw fixation and 19.7% for hamstring tendon (HT) autografts with EndoButton and screw fixation. The incidence of contralateral ACL injury was 13.7%. The mean IKDC score at 5 years (86.6 ± 10.9) was comparable to that at 2 years (86.8 ± 10.1). Patients were more likely to RTP with each year of decreasing age (OR, 1.06; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), with a higher preoperative Marx score (OR, 1.08; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) or a higher 5-year IKDC score (OR, 1.06; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). The risk of ipsilateral ACL reinjury increased each year of decreasing age (OR, 1.11; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) or when an HT autograft was used (OR, 5.56; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Younger age was also associated with contralateral ACL injury (OR, 1.1; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Female sex, older age, concomitant meniscal/chondral injuries, and lower preoperative Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sport after Injury scores were associated with lower IKDC scores at 5 years.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Most patients could return to level 1 sports, although their performance level was impacted. Those who returned to sport maintained their performance level over the 5 years. The ipsilateral reinjury rate for BPTB autografts with screws was significantly lower than that for HT autografts with EndoButton and screw fixation. Most ACL reinjuries occurred between 2 and 5 years of follow-up. Younger patients had an increased risk of a subsequent ACL injury to either knee, regardless of graft type. IKDC scores were lower in female patients, older patients, and those with concomitant meniscal/cartilage injuries.</AbstractText>

TI  - Patellar tendon or semitendinosus tendon autografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction? A prospective randomized study with a two-year follow-up.
PY  - 2003
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">There are well-known problems with the use of bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, especially in terms of donor site morbidity.

TI  - Meniscus transplantation: indications, techniques, clinical outcomes
PY  - 2005
AB  - Although many meniscus tears can be successfully repaired, not all are salvageable, especially if considerable tissue damage has occurred. Meniscus transplantation has been shown to be an acceptable procedure for younger patients. The primary candidate is a patient younger than age 50 years who has had a total meniscectomy and who either has pain in the tibiofemoral compartment, arthroscopic evidence of articular cartilage deterioration, or both. Contraindications are advanced knee joint arthrosis with flattening of the femoral condyle, concavity of the tibial plateau, and osteophytes that prevent anatomic seating of the meniscus allograft; axial malalignment; knee joint instability; knee arthrofibrosis; muscular atrophy; and prior joint infection. Prophylactic meniscus transplantation after total meniscectomy is not recommended in asymptomatic patients who do not demonstrate articular cartilage deterioration because long-term predictable success rates are not available. Most clinical studies on meniscus transplantation have reported improvements in knee function and pain, especially in patients who have symptoms affecting daily activities, as there are few if any other available treatment options.

TI  - Clinical and Radiological Regeneration of Large and Deep Osteochondral Defects of the Knee by Bone Augmentation Combined With Matrix-Guided Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background:Large osteochondral defects of the knee are a challenge for regenerative treatment. While matrix-guided autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) represents a successful treatment for chondral defects, the treatment potential in combination with bone grafting by cancellous bone or bone block augmentation for large and deep osteochondral defects has not been evaluated.Purpose:To evaluate 1- to 3-year clinical outcomes and radiological results on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after the treatment of large osteochondral defects of the knee with bone augmentation and MACT. Special emphasis is placed on different methods of bone grafting (cancellous bone grafting or bone block augmentation).Study Design:Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Methods:Fifty-one patients were included. Five patients were lost to follow-up. This left 46 patients (mean age, 28.2 years) with a median follow-up time of 2 years.

TI  - Patient Acceptable Symptom State Thresholds for IKDC-SKF and KOOS at the 10-Year Follow-up After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: A Study From the Delaware-Oslo ACL Cohort.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Clinicians need thresholds for the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) and Treatment Failure to interpret group-based patient-reported outcome measures after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Validated thresholds that are crucial for accurately discerning patient symptom state and facilitating effective interpretation have not been determined for long-term follow-up after ACL injury.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Purpose" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To calculate and validate thresholds for PASS and Treatment Failure for the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales at the 10-year follow-up after ACL injury.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Study Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 163 participants with unilateral ACL injury (treated with reconstruction or rehabilitation alone) from the Delaware-Oslo ACL Cohort were included. Thresholds for PASS were calculated for IKDC-SKF and KOOS subscales using anchor-based predictive modeling and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Too few participants had self-reported Treatment Failure to calculate thresholds for that outcome. Nonparametric bootstrapping was used to derive 95% CIs. The criterion validity of the predictive modeling and ROC-derived thresholds were assessed by comparing actual patient-reported PASS outcome with the calculated PASS outcome for each method of calculation and calculating their positive and negative predictive values with respect to the anchor questions.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 127 (78%) participants reported satisfactory symptom state. Predictive modeling PASS thresholds (95% CIs) were 76.2 points (72.1-79.4 points) for IKDC-SKF, 85.4 points (80.9-89.2 points) for KOOS Pain, 76.5 points (67.8-84.7 points) for KOOS Symptoms, 93.8 points (90.1-96.9 points) for KOOS activities of daily living, 71.6 points (63.4-77.7 points) for KOOS Sports, and 59.0 points (53.7-63.9 points) for KOOS quality of life (QoL). Predictive modeling thresholds classified 81% to 93% of the participants as having satisfactory symptom state, whereas ROC-derived thresholds classified &gt;50% as unsatisfied. The thresholds for IKDC-SKF, KOOS Sports, and KOOS QoL resulted in the most accurate percentages of PASS among all identified thresholds and therefore demonstrate the highest validity.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Predictive modeling provided valid PASS thresholds for IKDC-SKF and KOOS at the 10-year follow-up after ACL injury. The thresholds for IKDC-SKF, KOOS Sports, and KOOS QoL should be used when determining satisfactory outcomes. ROC-derived thresholds result in substantial misclassification rates of the participants who reported satisfactory symptom state.</AbstractText>

TI  - Allograft bone augmentation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2004
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a commonly performed procedure associated with predictable results in most patients. Intraoperative and postoperative complications can occur in up to 20% of surgeries and could result in the need for revision procedures. The following technical report describes the use of allograft corticocancellous bone for supplemental interference fixation of a bone-patellar tendon-bone ACL autograft within a tibial tunnel in which anterior widening occurred as a complication of reaming. This technique was used to obtain and improve aperture outlet fixation of the autograft within the tibial tunnel while maintaining adequate position and tension on the ACL graft-fixation construct. Clinical follow up at 36 months has revealed radiographic incorporation of the allograft into the tibial tunnel as well as optimal subjective, objective, and functional outcomes as measured by patient response, physical examination, and serial KT-1000 (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) arthrometer data. This technique could be useful in revision cases in which tunnel enlargement and/or widening is noted.

TI  - Rotational knee laxity: reliability of a simple measurement device in vivo.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Background
Double bundle ACL reconstruction has been demonstrated to decrease rotational knee laxity. However, there is no simple, commercially-available device to measure knee rotation. The investigators developed a simple, non-invasive device to measure knee rotation. In conjunction with a rigid boot to rotate the tibia and a force/moment sensor to allow precise determination of torque about the knee, a magnetic tracking system measures the axial rotation of the tibia with respect to the femur. This device has been shown to have acceptable levels of test re-test reliability to measure knee rotation in cadaveric knees.

TI  - Original Article With Video Illustration A Pilot Study of Anatomic Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Ligament Remnant Tissue Preservation
PY  - 2012
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the preliminary results of an anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction procedure with ligament remnant tissue preservation. Methods: By use of the transtibial technique, 2 doubled semitendinosus tendons were grafted into 4 tunnels created at the center of each bundle attachment, penetrating the ACL remnant tissue. In total, 44 patients (27 male and 17 female patients) with an isolated ACL injury underwent ACL reconstruction with this procedure. The mean age of the patients was 29 years (range, 17 to 58 years). Postoperative clinical evaluations were performed at 16.6 months on average (range, 12 to 23 months). Radiologic evaluations were also performed to evaluate the tunnel location in the femur and the tibia. Results: The mean operation time was 86 minutes (range, 72 to 96 minutes) in the cases with ACL reconstruction only. Postoperatively, the mean anterior laxity was 0.7 mm. The postoperative pivot-shift test was negative in 81.8% of the patients, whereas there were no patients evaluated as . No patients showed any extension or flexion deficit. There were no patients evaluated as “nearly abnormal” or “abnormal” according to the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation. The tunnel angles of the 4 tunnels were identical to those reported in a previous study. Conclusions: The minimal 1-year clinical results of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with ligament remnant tissue preservation were comparable to previously reported results of anatomic double-bundle reconstruction without remnant tissue preservation. Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Overconstraint Associated With a Modified Lemaire Lateral Extra-Articular Tenodesis Is Decreased by Using an Anterior Femoral Insertion Point in a Cadaveric Model.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To investigate tibiofemoral knee kinematics when shifting the femoral insertion point of the modified Lemaire lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) anterior to the lateral epicondyle.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Six fresh-frozen human knee joints were tested on a test bench in the following states: (1) native, (2) anterolateral insufficient, (3) original Lemaire (oLET; insertion point: 4 mm posterior and 8 mm proximal to the epicondyle), (4) anterior Lemaire (aLET; insertion point: 5 mm anterior and 5 mm proximal to the epicondyle). Internal tibial rotation was statically investigated under an internal tibial torque of 5 Nm in 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion. Anterior translation was statically investigated during a simulated Lachman test with an anterior translational force of 98 N. Additionally, the range of internal tibial rotation and anterior translation were dynamically investigated by a simulated pivot-shift test. Tibiofemoral kinematics were measured using an optical 3D motion analysis system.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The aLET showed an internal tibial rotation comparable to the native state for all tested flexion angles except 90° (0°: P = .201; 30°: P = .118; 60°: P = .126; 90°: P = .026). The oLET showed an internal tibial rotation below the values of the native state for all tested flexion angles indicating an overconstraint (0°: P = .003; 30°: P = .009; 60°: P = .029; 90°: P = .029). Direct comparisons between aLET and oLET showed a significantly decreased overconstraint at 0° and 30° of flexion (P = .001 and P = .003, respectively) when using the aLET. No differences in anterior translation and internal tibial rotation were found between the oLET and aLET during simulated Lachman and pivot-shift test (P &gt; .05), approximating the native state.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">An anteriorly shifted LET insertion point restored internal tibial rotation after anterolateral insufficiency to the native state while decreasing the overconstraint of internal tibial rotation induced by an LET using the originally described insertion point for small flexion angles ≤30°.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CLINICAL RELEVANCE" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Using an LET insertion point anterior to the epicondyle was recently reported to lower the risk of tunnel interference and has now been shown to restore internal tibial rotation effectively in vitro in the course of the present study. Concerns of overconstraining internal tibial rotation are not diminished by this technique, but using an anterior insertion point helps to decrease overconstraint.</AbstractText>

            <jats:title>Introduction:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Recurrent patellar dislocation which caused by Medial Patellofemoral Ligament (MPFL) injury could be treated by MPFL reconstruction. This study evaluated MPFL reconstruction using superficial layer of quadriceps tendon autograft with knee functional outcome.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Method:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Three patients with recurrent patellar dislocation underwent MPFL reconstruction with superficial layer of quadriceps tendon autograft. The central quadriceps tendon was harvested at the superficial layer of the tendon. Then the proximal autograft routed medially on the periosteal hinge through vastus medial muscle. Functional outcome using IKDC, Tegner-Lysholm, and Modified Cincinnati were assessed pre and post-operative.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Result:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>A good stability and painless knees were achieved. IKDC score, Tegner-Lysholm, and Modified Cincinnati was improved from pre-operative to post-operative. No severe postoperative complication was recorded.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Discussion:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The superficial layer of quadriceps tendon has similar biomechanical and anatomical macroscopic attribute to native MPFL. The procedure using quadriceps tendon was simple and has fewer complication than using other autografts, such as hamstring tendon, adductor tendon, and patellar tendon. The one-year follow-up outcome of this procedure is excellent.</jats:p>

            <jats:title>Conclusion:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>MPFL reconstruction with superficial layer of quadriceps tendon autograft was proven to prevent patellar dislocation without deteriorating quadriceps muscle strength and produced knee stabilization with functional score improvement.</jats:p>

TI  - More knee reinjuries after ACL reconstruction compared to nonsurgical treatment of the ACL. A 2-year follow-up of the NACOX prospective cohort study.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To describe knee reinjuries and surgeries within 2 years after an acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, in patients treated with or without ACL reconstruction (ACLR).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Two years follow-up of 275 patients (52% females, mean age 25.2 [SD 7.0] years) about knee reinjuries and surgeries were analysed from the prospective NACOX cohort study, aiming to describe recovery after an acute ACL injury treated according to clinical routine. Knee reinjury was defined as increase or new symptoms due to new trauma. At 2 years after injury, 169 (61%) had undergone an ACLR. Results are presented with descriptive statistics and risk ratios (RR).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Thirty-two patients sustained reinjuries within 2 years; 6 in the non-ACLR group, and 26 in the ACLR group (7 before and 19 after ACLR). Twelve patients in the ACLR group sustained a graft rupture and three did an ACL revision. Patients with non-ACLR, aged 21-25 years, had a 5.9-fold higher risk for reinjury than those aged 15-20 years (RR 5.9 [1.3-26.9]; p = 0.012). Twenty-four patients had surgery in the non-ACLR group and 36 patients in the ACLR group (excluding primary ACLR), where six were before ACLR and 30 were after ACLR.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Twelve percent sustained a knee reinjury and 21% underwent knee surgery within 2 years after the index ACL injury. There was a higher reinjury incidence in the ACLR group, but no difference in incidence of surgeries. Thus, ACLR did not reduce the risk of traumatic reinjuries or surgeries, which is important for treatment decision considerations.</AbstractText>

TI  - Brace-Free Rehabilitation after Isolated Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Hamstring Tendon Autograft Is Not Inferior to Brace-Based Rehabilitation-A Randomised Controlled Trial.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The postoperative use of a rehabilitative knee brace after isolated primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) using a hamstring tendon (HT) autograft is controversial. A knee brace may provide subjective safety but can cause damage if applied incorrectly. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a knee brace on clinical outcomes following isolated ACLR using HT autograft.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">In this prospective randomised trial, 114 adults (32.4 ± 11.5 years, 35.1% women) underwent isolated ACLR using HT autograft after primary ACL rupture. Patients were randomly assigned to wear either a knee brace (<i>n</i> = 58) or no brace (<i>n</i> = 56) for 6 weeks postoperatively. An initial examination was performed preoperatively, and at 6 weeks and 4, 6, and 12 months. The primary endpoint was the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score to measure participants' subjective perceptions. Secondary endpoints included objective knee function assessed by IKDC, instrumented knee laxity measurements, isokinetic strength tests of the knee extensors and flexors, Lysholm Knee Score, Tegner Activity Score, Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury Score, and quality of life determined by Short Form-36 (SF36).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">There were no statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences in IKDC scores between the two study groups (3.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.39 to 7.97, <i>p</i> = 0.03 for evidence of non-inferiority of brace-free compared with brace-based rehabilitation). The difference in Lysholm score was 3.20 (95% CI -2.47 to 8.87); the difference in SF36 physical component score 0.09 (95% CI -1.93 to 3.03). In addition, isokinetic testing did not reveal any clinically relevant differences between the groups (n.s.).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Brace-free rehabilitation is non-inferior to a brace-based protocol regarding physical recovery 1 year after isolated ACLR using HT autograft. Consequently, the use of a knee brace might be avoided after such a procedure.</AbstractText>

TI  - Hydrogels for the Application of Articular Cartilage Tissue Engineering: A Review of Hydrogels
PY  - 2018
AB  - The treatment of articular cartilage damage is a major task in the medical science of orthopedics. Hydrogels possess the ability to form multifunctional cartilage grafts since they possess polymeric swellability upon immersion in an aqueous phase. Polymeric hydrogels are capable of physiological swelling and greasing, and they possess the mechanical behavior required for use as articular cartilage substitutes. The chondrogenic phenotype of these materials may be enhanced by embedding living cells. Artificial hydrogels fabricated from biologically derived and synthesized polymeric materials are also used as tissue-engineering scaffolds; with their controlled degradation profiles, the release of stimulatory growth factors can be achieved. In order to make use of these hydrogels, cartilage implants were formulated in the laboratory to demonstrate the bionic mechanical behaviors of physiological cartilage. This paper discusses developments concerning the use of polymeric hydrogels for substituting injured cartilage tissue and assisting tissue growth. These gels are designed with consideration of their polymeric classification, mechanical strength, manner of biodegradation, limitations of the payload, cellular interaction, amount of cells in the 3D hydrogel, sustained release for the model drug, and the different approaches for incorporation into adjacent organs. This article also summarizes the different advantages, disadvantages, and the future prospects of hydrogels.

TI  - WITHDRAWN: Interventions for tears of the rotator cuff in adults.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Background Tears of the rotator cuff tendons, which surround the joints of the shoulder, are one of the most common causes of pain and disability in the upper extremity. Objectives To review the efficacy and safety of common interventions for tears of the rotator cuff in adults. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group specialised trail register (July 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2001), EMBASE (1974 to December 2001), Biological Abstracts (1980 to December 2001), LILACS (1982 to December 2001), CINAHL (November 1982 to December 2001), Science Citation Index and reference lists of articles. We also contacted authors and handsearched conference proceedings focusing on shoulder conditions. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials involving tears of the rotator cuff were the focus of this review. All trials involving conservative interventions or surgery were included (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular or subacromial glucocorticosteroid injection, oral glucocorticosteroid treatment, physiotherapy, and open or arthroscopic surgery). Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed suitability for inclusion, methodological quality and extracted data. Dichotomous data were presented as relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), using the fixed effects model. Main results Eight trials involving 455 people were included and 393 patients analysed. Trials were grouped in eight categories of conservative or surgical treatment. The median quality score of all trials combined was 16 out of a possible 24 points, with a range of 12-18. In general, included trials differed on diagnostic criteria for rotator cuff tear, there was no uniformity in reported outcome measures, and data which could be summarised were rarely reported. Only results from two studies comparing open repair to arthroscopic debridement could be pooled. There is weak evidence for the superiority of open repair of rotator cuff tears compared with arthroscopic debridement. Authors' conclusions There is little evidence to support or refute the efficacy of common interventions for tears of rotator cuff in adults. As well as the need for further well designed clinical trials, uniform methods of defining interventions for rotator cuff tears and validated outcome measures are also essential.

TI  - Bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft versus LARS artificial ligament for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2013
AB  - Springer-Verlag 2012 Abstract The optimized graft for use in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is still in controversy. The bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft has been accepted as the gold standard for ACL reconstruction. However, donor site morbidities cannot be avoided after this treatment. The artificial ligament of ligament advanced reinforcement system (LARS) has been recommended for ACL reconstruction. The purpose of this study is to com- pare the midterm outcome of ACL reconstruction using BPTB autografts or LARS ligaments. Between July 2004 and March 2006, the ACL reconstruction using BPTB autografts in 30 patients and LARS ligaments in 32 patients was performed. All patients were followed up for at least 4 years and evaluated using the Lysholm knee score, Tegner score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and KT-1000 arthrometer test. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the data of Lysholm scores, Tegner scores, IKDC scores, and KT-1000 arthrometer test at the latest follow-up. Our study demonstrates that the similarly good clinical results are obtained after ACL reconstruction using BPTB autografts or LARS ligaments at midterm fol- low-up. In addition to BPTB autografts, the LARS ligament may be a satisfactory treatment option for ACL rupture.

TI  - A randomized trial of treatment for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The aim of this study was to explore the effects of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) in patients with anterior cruciate ligament(ACL) reconstruction(ACLR).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving 72 eligible patients with ACL reconstruction in which we compared two strategies: the experimental group was standard rehabilitation plus rESWT and the control group was standard rehabilitation plus sham rESWT. The outcome was the change from baseline to 24 weeks in the average score on Lysholm knee joint score (LKS), range of motion (ROM), visual analogue scale (VAS) and International Knee Literature Committee (IKDC).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Of 36 subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus rESWT, 4 lost to follow up. Of 36 assigned to rehabilitation plus sham rESWT, 5 lost to follow up. The LKS, ROM and IKDC scores of the experimental group were markedly increased at 3 and 6 weeks after treatment (P &lt; 0.001), and the VAS was notably decreased (P &lt; 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in the LKS, ROM, IKDC and VAS between the groups at 24 weeks after treatment (P &gt; 0.05).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The strategy of rehabilitation plus rESWT had better functional outcomes after ACL reconstruction. As such, our study demonstrates that rESWT is essential for patients with ACL reconstruction. Early use of rESWT can improve joint function, pain relief and ability of daily living. rESWT has a positive effect on the overall rehabilitation of patients.</AbstractText>

TI  - Arthrogenic muscle inhibition after anterior cruciate ligament injury: Injured and uninjured limb recovery over time.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Introduction" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">It is well documented that marked weakness of the quadriceps is present after knee joint injury. This joint trauma induces a presynaptic reflex inhibition of musculature surrounding the joint, termed arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI). The extent to which anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury affects thigh musculature motor unit activity, which may affect restoration of thigh muscle strength after injury, is undetermined.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A randomized protocol of knee flexion and extension isometric contractions (10%-50% maximal voluntary isometric contraction) were performed for each leg on 54 subjects with electromyography array electrodes placed on the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris. Longitudinal assessments for motor unit recruitment and average firing rate were acquired at 6-month intervals for 1 year post ACL injury.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The ACL-injured population demonstrated smaller quadriceps and hamstrings motor unit size (assessed <i>via</i> motor unit action potential peak-to-peak amplitude) and altered firing rate activity in both injured and uninjured limbs compared to healthy controls. Motor unit activity remained altered compared to healthy controls at 12 months post ACL reconstruction (ACLR).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Discussion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Motor unit activity was altered after ACLR up to 12 months post-surgery. Further research is warranted to optimize rehabilitation interventions that adequately address altered motor unit activity and improve safety and success with return to sport after ACLR. In the interim, evidence based clinical reasoning with a focus on development of muscular strength and power capacity should be the impetus behind rehabilitation programming to address motor control deficits.</AbstractText>

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries: Consensus of Chinese experts part II: Graft selection and clinical outcome evaluation.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">In the recent decade, there has been substantial progress in the technologies and philosophies associated with diagnosing and treating anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in China. The therapeutic efficacy of ACL reconstruction in re-establishing the stability of the knee joint has garnered widespread acknowledgment. However, the path toward standardizing diagnostic and treatment protocols remains to be further developed and refined.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Objective" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">In this context, the Chinese Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (CAOS) and the Chinese Society of Sports Medicine (CSSM) collaboratively developed an expert consensus on diagnosing and treating ACL injury, aiming to enhance medical quality through refining professional standards.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The consensus drafting team invited experts across the Greater China region, including the mainland, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, to formulate and review the consensus using a modified Delphi method as a standardization approach. As members of the CSSM Lower Limb Study Group and the CAOS Arthroscopy and Sports Medicine Study Group, invited experts concentrated on two pivotal issues: "Graft Selection" and "Clinical Outcome Evaluation" during the second part of the consensus development.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This focused discussion ultimately led to a strong consensus on nine specific consensus terms.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The consensus clearly states that ACL reconstruction has no definitive "gold standard" graft choice. Autografts have advantages in healing capability but are limited in availability and have potential donor site morbidities; allografts reduce surgical trauma but incur additional costs, and there are concerns about slow healing, quality control issues, and a higher failure rate in young athletes; synthetic ligaments allow for early rehabilitation and fast return to sport, but the surgery is technically demanding and incurs additional costs. When choosing a graft, one should comprehensively consider the graft's characteristics, the doctor's technical ability, and the patient's needs. When evaluating clinical outcomes, it is essential to ensure an adequate sample size and follow-up rate, and the research should include patient subjective scoring, joint function and stability, complications, surgical failure, and the return to sport results. Medium and long-term follow-ups should not overlook the assessment of knee osteoarthritis.</AbstractText>

PY  - 2014
AB  - Meniscal lesions are frequent during sport practice. Although the lateral meniscus is affected in only 25% of all meniscal lesions, lateral lesions are usually known to have poor clinical outcome. Our monocentric study consisted in the systematic evaluation of all patients treated in our unit for a unique lesion of the lateral meniscus in an otherwise normal knee. Follow-up was of at least ten years. Functional results were rated with four grades currently used in traumatology practice. Statistical analysis was conducted to identify predictive factors of poor outcome. Thirty-nine patients were included. Functional assessment showed 12% of excellent, 41% of good, 35% of mediocre and 12% of poor results on Arpege’s score; 65% of good and excellent and 35% of mediocre results on Lysholm’s score. The average subjective IKDC score 58 ± 15, the objective score showed 0% of A, 88% of B and 12% of C. The average Koos score was 83.7 ± 17. Better outcome was noted in patients with horizontal injuries (P = 0.04) or in patients with central segment injury (P = 0.05). Similar data concerning the poor functional outcome of lateral meniscus tears have been published. Only two thirds of patients claim good or excellent results after 10 years. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with quadriceps tendon composite autograft.
PY  - 2001
AB  - At present, no single graft option clearly outperforms another. Autografts (patellar tendon, hamstring) and allografts (Achilles tendon, patellar tendon) are the grafts most often used. However, each grafts has advantages and disadvantages. Quadriceps tendon graft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is not new, but an alternative composite graft is introduced here that consists of quadriceps tendon-patellar bone and bone obtained from a coring reamer used to create the tibial tunnel. This composite graft retains reduced morbidity while allowing the secure bone-to-bone fixation associated with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft.

AB  - Background: Osteoarthritis of the knee is commonly diagnosed and monitored with radiography. However, the reliability of radiographic classification systems for osteoarthritis and the correlation of these classifications with the actual degree of confirmed degeneration of the articular cartilage of the tibiofemoral joint have not been adequately studied.

Methods: As the Multicenter ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) Revision Study (MARS) Group, we conducted a multicenter, prospective longitudinal cohort study of patients undergoing revision surgery after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. We followed 632 patients who underwent radiographic evaluation of the knee (an anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph, a posteroanterior weight-bearing radiograph made with the knee in 45° of flexion [Rosenberg radiograph], or both) and arthroscopic evaluation of the articular surfaces. Three blinded examiners independently graded radiographic findings according to six commonly used systems—the Kellgren-Lawrence, International Knee Documentation Committee, Fairbank, Brandt et al., Ahlback, and Jager-Wirth classifications. Interobserver reliability was assessed with use of the intraclass correlation coefficient. The association between radiographic classification and arthroscopic findings of tibiofemoral chondral disease was assessed with use of the Spearman correlation coefficient.

Results: Overall, 45° posteroanterior flexion weight-bearing radiographs had higher interobserver reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.65) compared with anteroposterior radiographs (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.56). Similarly, the 45° posteroanterior flexion weight-bearing radiographs had higher correlation with arthroscopic findings of chondral disease (Spearman rho = 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.39) compared with anteroposterior radiographs (Spearman rho = 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.32). With respect to standards for the magnitude of the reliability coefficient and correlation coefficient (Spearman rho), the International Knee Documentation Committee classification demonstrated the best combination of good interobserver reliability and medium correlation with arthroscopic findings.

Conclusions: The overall estimates with the six radiographic classification systems demonstrated moderate (anteroposterior radiographs) to good (45° posteroanterior flexion weight-bearing radiographs) interobserver reliability and medium correlation with arthroscopic findings. The International Knee Documentation Committee classification assessed with use of 45° posteroanterior flexion weight-bearing radiographs had the most favorable combination of reliability and correlation.

TI  - Early knee status affects self-reported knee function 1 year after non-surgically treated anterior cruciate ligament injury.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Objectives The primary aim was to assess impact of early knee status on self-reported knee function at 3 and 12 months and on quadriceps strength at 12 months after non-surgically treated ACL injury. The secondary aim was to describe the recovery of muscle strength during the first year after the injury. Design Prospective cohort study. Participants 70 patients (42 males; mean age 27 ± 7 years) with acute ACL injury. Main outcome Knee symptoms, knee function and sporting activities were assessed with the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF). Muscle strength was assessed with an isokinetic dynamometer. Clinical assessment performed at baseline was used to evaluate early knee status. Results Global knee function, knee joint stability during ADL, gait pattern and one-legged squat assessed in mean 2 weeks after injury hadimpact on self-reported knee function at 3 and 12 months (r2 0.105–0.267). Mean limb symmetry index (LSI) of muscle strength and jump performance were 91–98% at 12 months. Conclusion Early knee symptoms affect self-reported knee function at 3 and 12 months, while other factors are important for gaining muscle strength. Muscle strength recovered during the first year after ACL injury and reached mean LSI above 90%. Level of evidence Prospective cohort study, level II.

TI  - ST/G ACL reconstruction: double strand plus extra-articular sling vs double bundle, randomized study at 3-year follow-up.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Several investigators have reported the presence of biomechanical, kinematic, anatomic, fiber orientation patterns and biological differences between the anteromedial bundle and the posterolateral bundle of ACL. The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function. From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability. The double-bundle technique for ACL reconstruction described in this paper has demonstrated significantly better subjective, objective and functional results compared with a double-stranded hamstrings plus extra-articular sling at a minimum 3-year follow-up.

TI  - Evaluation of Experimental and Clinical Efficacy on Surgical Debridement and Systemic Antibiotics Treatment for Early Knee Infection after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Deep knee infection (DKI) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is rare and challenging. The optimal treatment strategy for infection after ACLR remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the optimal treatment for early infection after ACLR surgery. Rats with unilateral ACLR were injected with 3.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units (CFU) of Staphylococcus aureus in the knee joint for 7 days. Next, with surgical debridement (SD) and/or 21 days of antimicrobial (systemic vancomycin and oral rifampicin [SVR]) therapy, rats were euthanatized and samples harvested. We evaluated signs of infection by general postoperative conditions, serum inflammatory markers, microbiological counting, knee radiographs, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), histologic staining, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Clinically, the data from 12 patients who suffered from DKI after ACLR were analyzed retrospectively. The DKI rats treated with SVR showed better outcomes in general postoperative conditions, serum inflammatory markers, microbiological counting, biofilm on the interference screw and graft, radiographic signs of periarticular osseous destruction, and inflammatory reaction in the joint tissues than those with SD treatment, while the DKI rats with SD and SVR administration showed the best outcomes. Rats which received SD and SVR administration had their S. aureus contamination completely eradicated. All patients treated with SD & SVR or SVR alone had effectively controlled knee infections and achieved good knee function outcomes in the 6 months after treatment, but one patient developed more serious knee infections. Therefore, surgical debridement combined with systemic antibiotics treatment could effectively eliminate S. aureus contamination in the DKI rat model and in patients after ACLR without affecting knee function. Treatment with systemic antibiotics could also control early DKI, which would be especially applicable in patients who could not tolerate surgery.

TI  - Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in a patient with Athetoid cerebral palsy: a case report.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Recent years have seen ACL reconstruction performed in a broad range of patients, regardless of age, sex or occupation, thanks to great advances in surgical techniques, instrumentation and the basic research. Favorable results have been reported; however, we have not been able to locate any reports describing ACL reconstruction in patients with athetoid cerebral palsy. We present herein a previously unreported anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction performed in a patient with athetoid cerebral palsy. The patient was a 25-year-old woman with level II athetoid cerebral palsy according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System. She initially injured her right knee after falling off a bicycle. Two years later, she again experienced right-knee pain and a feeling of instability. A right-knee ACL tear and avulsion fracture was diagnosed upon physical examination and confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray examination at that time. An ACL reconstruction using an autologous hamstring double-bundle graft was performed for recurrent instability nine years after the initial injury. Cast immobilization was provided for 3 weeks following surgery and knee extension was restricted for 3 months with the functional ACL brace to prevent hyperextension due to involuntary movement. Partial weight-bearing was started 1 week postoperatively, with full weight-bearing after 4 weeks. The anterior drawer stress radiography showed a 63% anterior displacement of the involved tibia on the femur six months following the surgery, while the contralateral knee demonstrated a 60% anterior displacement of the tibia. The functional ACL functional brace was then removed. A second-look arthroscopy was performed 13 months after the ACL reconstruction, and both the anteromedial and posterolateral bundles were in excellent position as per Kondo’s criteria. The Lachman and pivot shift test performed under anesthesia were also negative. An anterior drawer stress radiography of the involved knee at 36 months following surgery showed a 61% anterior translation of the tibia. The preoperative symptoms of instability resolved and the patient expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the result of her surgery.

TI  - Arthroskopische kombinierte vordere und hintere Kreuzbandrekonstruktion
PY  - 1998
AB  - Kombinierte Lasionen des vorderen (VKB) und des hinteren Kreuzbandes (HKB) sind sehr seltene Verletzungen und werden meist im Rahmen einer traumatischen Knieluxation beobachtet. Oft sind sie mit weiteren ligamentaren Verletzungen (mediales Kollateralband (MCL), posterolateraler Komplex) kombiniert. Gerade bei polytraumatisierten Patienten werden kombinierte Lasionen des VKB und des HKB nach spontaner Reposition ubersehen oder nur als reine hintere Instabilitat fehlgedeutet. Wahrend fur die Indikationen und die operativen Verfahren der arthroskopischen [10] und arthroskopischassistierten Rekonstruktionen des VKB im wesentlichen weitgehend Einigkeit herrscht [6, 12], sind die Behandlungsstrategien fur Verletzungen des HKB, ob offen oder arthroskopisch [13, 15], Implantatwahl, Zeitpunkt der Versorgung, noch deutlich kontroverser [2, 14] und reichen von rein konservativer bis zur fruh operativen Versorgung mit [5] und ohne Augmentation [3].

TI  - Comparison of Anatomic Double- and Single-Bundle Techniques for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Hamstring Tendon Autografts A Prospective Randomized Study With 5-Year Clinical and Radiographic Follow-up
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background:The aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare the outcomes of the anatomic double-bundle (DB) and anatomic single-bundle (SB) techniques 5 years after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Since more effective restoration of rotational laxity is considered the main advantage of the DB technique, the pivot-shift test was the primary outcome variable of the study.Hypothesis:Double-bundle ACL reconstruction will result in a better outcome in terms of the pivot-shift test.Study Design:Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.Methods:A total of 105 patients (33 women, 72 men; median age, 27 years; range, 18-52 years) were randomized and underwent ACL reconstruction (DB group, n = 53; SB group, n = 52).

TI  - Vergleich der vorderen Kreuzbandplastik durch das mittlere Patellarsehnendrittel Allograft mit dem mittleren Patellarsehnendrittel Autograft bei Revisionseingriffen
PY  - 2008
AB  - In der vorliegenden Studie wurde das klinische Ergebnis nach vorderer Kreuzbandplastik durch mechanisch gereinigtes fresh frozen Allograft aus dem mittleren Patellarsehnendrittel mit der, unter Zufallsauswahl bestimmten vorderen Kreuzbandplastik aus dem mittleren Patellarsehnendrittel Autograft verglichen. 
20 Patienten, die wahrend einer Zweitrekonstruktion des vorderen Kreuzbandes mit einem Patellarsehnendrittel Allograft versorgt worden waren, wurden durchschnittlich 20,4 Monate postoperativ nachuntersucht. Als Vergleichspopulation dienten 20 Patienten die, in der Operationsfolge als jeweils nachste, im Rahmen eines Revisionseingriffs mit einem mittleren Patellarsehnendrittel Autograft versorgt worden waren. Beide Gruppen unterschieden sich weder in Bezug auf das durchschnittliche Alter noch auf das Geschlecht signifikant voneinander.
Als Hauptzielkriterium fand das Formblatt zur Untersuchung des Knies des IKDC 2000 Scores Anwendung. Die Patienten wurden auf Stabilitat, Bewegungsumfang, 
Schmerzsymptomatik und auf radiologische Veranderungen hin untersucht. 
Die objektive Messung der vorderen Translation durch den KT 1000™ Knee Ligament Arthrometer® zeigte keinen signifikanten Unterschied zwischen beiden Gruppen.
Das durchschnittliche postoperative Schmerzverhalten erwies sich in der Allograftgruppe als signifikant niedriger im Vergleich zur Autograftgruppe (kleinstes p= 0.007).
Ein signifikanter Unterschied im Schmerzverhalten zum Zeitpunkt der Nachuntersuchung konnte nicht nachgewiesen werden.
Bei deutlich mehr Patienten der Autograftgruppe konnte wahrend der Nachuntersuchung ein Extensionsdefizit festgestellt werden (p=0,008). Hingegen zeigte die radiologische Diagnostik keine signifikanten Unterschiede hinsichtlich degenerativer Veranderungen.
Bei der subjektiven Beurteilung durch die Patienten auf Grundlage des IKDC 2000 Scores (Formblattes zur subjektiven Beurteilung des Knies) konnte ebenfalls kein signifikanter Unterschied zwischen beiden Gruppen ermittelt werden.
Die Auswertung des Formblattes zur Untersuchung des Knies des IKDC 2000 Scores ergab bei 15% der Patienten der Allograftgruppe eine Zuordnung zur Leistungsgruppe A, bei 75% zur Leistungsgruppe B. 10% der Patienten konnten hier der Kategorie C zugeordnet werden. Bei der Auswertung der Autograftgruppe konnten 10% der Patienten der Leistungsgruppe A zugeordnet werden, 75% der Gruppe B und 15% der Gruppe C. Dieser Unterschied war nicht signifikant.
Bei allen in der Studie untersuchten Patienten wurde durch den Revisionseingriff eine deutliche klinische Verbesserung erreicht. 
Die von uns verwendeten Allografttransplantate erwiesen sich gegenuber den damit verglichenen Autografttransplantaten sowohl im Hinblick auf Stabilitat, als auch in anderen wichtigen klinischen Aspekten, zum Zeitpunkt der Nachuntersuchung als gleichwertig. Den Vorteilen des gunstigeren postoperativen Schmerzverhaltens, der nicht vorhandenen Entnahmemorbiditat, sowie des besseren Extensionsverhaltens, stehen Nachteile wie ein, wenn auch geringes, potentielles Infektionsrisiko und hohere Kosten gegenuber.
Unserer Ansicht nach stellen mechanisch gereinigte fresh frozen Allografts eine empfehlenswerte Alternative zu autologen Transplantaten des mittleren Patellarsehnendrittels dar.

TI  - Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using cryopreserved allografts.
PY  - 2004
AB  - Primary ACL reconstruction historically has been done using autograft tissues whereas allografts have been limited to revision cases and patients who are older or with lower physical demands because some animal studies suggested a slower biologic incorporation rate. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the cryopreserved Achilles tendon allograft in primary ACL reconstruction in a consecutive series of athletes. Fifty consecutive patients with a strenuous or moderate preinjury activity level, as defined by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), had ACL reconstruction using cryopreserved Achilles tendon allografts secured with bioabsorbable interference screws. Five patients were professional athletes. The average age of the patients was 36 years (range, 17-50 years). A 3- to 5-year followup study was done in all of the patients using the IKDC form. Tunnel widening was measured in the lateral radiographs at the widest level. The overall outcome was normal or nearly normal in 94% of the patients. No failures were reported in this series. Forty-six patients (92%) returned to their same preinjury sport activity level. The average KT-1000 side-to-side difference was 2,3 mm. Average tibial tunnel widening was 2, 7 mm (range, 0-6 mm); no significant correlation was observed between increased tunnel size and a fair or poor clinical outcome. This experience shows that favorable results can be obtained with cryopreserved Achilles tendon allografts in athletes in whom avoiding donor site morbidity may be an issue in terms of a prompt return to sport.

TI  - Additional surgery after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: can we improve technical aspects of the initial procedure?
PY  - 2007
AB  - Purpose: To determine factors that cause reoperation after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and determine which cause of reoperation can be addressed to help to improve technical aspects of the initial procedure. Methods: Between 1988 and 1998, 436 patients underwent an ACL reconstruction by a single surgeon. We analyzed all 207 patients who had a bone–patellar tendon–bone reconstruction (BPTB). The same technique was used in all operations, which consisted of the 1-incision endoscopic approach with autologous central third patellar–tendon graft. Of these patients, 196 were available for full evaluation. Evaluation included: a detailed history, physical examination, functional knee ligament testing, KT-1000 arthrometer testing, One-leg-hop testing, Lysholm score, Tegner score, and the International Knee Documentation Committee standard evaluation form. All technical surgical aspects concerning the index operation and the reoperations were collected and evaluated in detail to detect predictors for failure or improvement. Position of the graft was measured radiographically using the Amis circle and Taylor score. Results: The average age of the 196 patients at the time of the operation was 34 years, and the mean duration of follow-up was 7.4 years. Seventy-seven reoperations were performed in 54 (27.6%) patients during a period of 83 months postsurgery. Reoperations were done between day 22 and 83 months post–ACL reconstruction. Indications for reoperations were: pain caused by fixation material (n = 25); meniscal lesions (n = 24); cyclops lesion (n = 16); donor site morbidity (n = 5); re-rupture of the ACL (n = 5); posterior cruciate ligament rupture (n = 1); and a medial collateral ligament lesion (n = 1). A more ventral position of the graft on the femur (Amis P P P Conclusions: A large percentage of the patients (27.6%) required additional surgical procedures after patellar tendon autograft ACL reconstruction. A poor position of the graft resulted in cyclops and meniscal lesions. Analyzing the reasons for reoperations gives information about how to improve our surgical technique. Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - HOW TO PERFORM A META-ANALYSIS: A PRACTICAL STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE USING R SOFTWARE AND RSTUDIO.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Meta-analysis is an adequate statistical technique to combine results from different studies, and its use has been growing in the medical field. Thus, not only knowing how to interpret meta-analysis, but also knowing how to perform one, is fundamental today. Therefore, the objective of this article is to present the basic concepts and serve as a guide for conducting a meta-analysis using R and RStudio software. For this, the reader has access to the basic commands in the R and RStudio software, necessary for conducting a meta-analysis. The advantage of R is that it is a free software. For a better understanding of the commands, two examples were presented in a practical way, in addition to revising some basic concepts of this statistical technique. It is assumed that the data necessary for the meta-analysis has already been collected, that is, the description of methodologies for systematic review is not a discussed subject. Finally, it is worth remembering that there are many other techniques used in meta-analyses that were not addressed in this work. However, with the two examples used, the article already enables the reader to proceed with good and robust meta-analyses. <b><i>Level of Evidence V, Expert Opinion.</i></b>

TI  - Self-reported patient outcomes at a minimum of 5 years after allograft anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with or without medial meniscus transplantation: an age-, sex-, and activity level-matched comparison in patients aged approximately 50 years.
PY  - 2006
AB  - Purpose: Patient outcomes at a minimum of 5 years after medial meniscus transplantation and primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction via allograft tissues were compared with those of age–, sex–, and activity level–matched patients who underwent meniscal repair or partial meniscectomy and primary ACL reconstruction via allograft tissues. Methods: Eight patients (mean age, 51 ± 5 years; three women and five men) at 5.5 ± 0.5 years after medial meniscus transplantation and ACL reconstruction (group 1) and eight matched patients (mean age, 50 ± 5 years; three women and five men) at 5.1 ± 0.5 years after meniscal repair or partial meniscectomy and ACL reconstruction (group 2) completed the meniscus allograft clinical registry questionnaire, which combined the modified Lysholm knee scoring scale, the 1999 International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee evaluation, and the knee pain level score on a 10-cm visual analog scale. Results: Both groups displayed similar improvements in the modified Lysholm knee scoring scale components of pain, knee stability, squatting, stair climbing, and limping, as well as overall score ( P P Conclusions: Although group 1 had greater preoperative knee pain levels, their pain levels at 5 years postoperatively were comparable to those in group 2. With the exception of swelling, comparable improvements were observed between groups for all other variables. Level of Evidence: Level III, retrospective, case-control study.

TI  - Comparison of Clinical Results, Second-Look Arthroscopic Findings, and MRI Findings Between the Transportal and Outside-In Techniques for Double-Bundle Anatomic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction A Prospective, Randomized Controlled Trial With a Minimum 2-Year Follow-up
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background:Although image analysis has shown that the outside-in (OI) technique is associated with different femoral tunnel geometry than the transportal (TP) technique in anatomic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, it is not known whether clinical results differ between the 2 techniques.Purpose:To compare clinical results, second-look arthroscopic findings, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings between the TP and OI techniques in anatomic double-bundle (DB) ACL reconstruction.Study Design:Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.Methods:From November 2010 to March 2013, 128 patients were enrolled in this study and were randomly assigned to either the TP group (64 patients) or the OI group (64 patients), and DB ACL reconstructions were performed. At the minimum 2-year follow-up (34.9 ± 10.9 months), 111 patients (86.7%) were evaluated with multiple clinical scores and stability tests (KT-2000 arthrometer, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test).

TI  - Long-Term Outcomes of Multiligament Knee Injuries.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE">To characterize long-term outcomes of multiligament knee injuries (MLKIs) using patient-reported outcome measures, physical examination, and knee radiographs.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="DESIGN">Retrospective clinical follow-up.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">Twenty knees (18 patients) were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 13.1 years (range 11-15 years). The primary outcome measure was the Internal Knee Documentation Committee score. Patients also completed secondary patient-based outcome assessments including Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computer adaptive testing, Short Form-36, and Tegner activity score. Sixteen knees (14 patients) also had physical examination and bilateral knee radiographs assessed with the Kellgren-Lawrence score.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">The mean Internal Knee Documentation Committee score was 56 points, which was significantly lower than the age-matched normative value of 77 ( P = 0.004) and exceeds the minimum clinically important difference of 12 points. Most secondary outcome scores were worse than normative population values. Posttraumatic arthritis was present in 100% of MLKIs that had radiographs. Comparing operative versus nonoperative management, there were no statistical differences in patient demographics, injury characteristics, physical examination, or imaging, but surgical patients had better Short Form-36 Social Functioning (89 vs. 63, P = 0.02) and Tegner scores (4.5 vs. 2.9, P = 0.05).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">The long-term outcomes of MLKIs are generally poor, and posttraumatic radiographic evidence of arthritis seems to be universal . Operative management of these injuries may improve long-term outcomes. Clinicians should be aware of these results when counseling patients.</AbstractText>

TI  - Ten year follow-up study comparing conservative versus operative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament ruptures. A matched-pair analysis of high level athletes
PY  - 2008
AB  - Objective: To compare long term outcome of highly active patients with anterior cruciate ligament ruptures treated operatively versus non-operatively. Design: We reviewed high level athletes with an anterior cruciate ligament rupture on either MRI or arthroscopic evaluation more than 10 years previously, who were treated conservatively. They were pair-matched with patients who had had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patella-tendon-bone, with respect to age, gender and Tegner activity score before injury. Participants: In total 50 patients were pair-matched. Results: We found no statistical difference between the patients treated conservatively or operatively with respect to osteoarthritis or meniscal lesions of the knee, as well as activity level, objective and subjective functional outcome. The patients who were treated operatively had a significantly better stability of the knee at examination. Conclusion: We conclude that the instability repair using a bone-patella-tendon-bone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a good knee stabilising operation. Both treatment options however show similar patient outcome at 10 year follow up.

TI  - Surgical Repair of Neglected Bucket-Handle Meniscal Tears Displaced into the Intercondylar Notch: Clinical and Radiological Results.
PY  - 2017
AB  - The literature contains very limited articles wherein the treatment results of bucket-handle meniscal tears according to various types are evaluated and wherein results for repair of chronic tears are discussed. The objective of this study is a clinical and radiologic evaluation of arthroscopic repair for patients suffering flipped, neglected chronic bucket-handle meniscal tear in the intercondylar notch. A total of 26 patients were evaluated retrospectively. The mean age at the time of surgery was 27 years (range, 16-44). Mean period from meniscal injury to surgery was 28 months (range, 4-96). The mean follow-up period was 31 months (range, 11-67). During the follow-up, the patients were evaluated clinically, functional scores from the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm, and Tegner as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The mean preoperative Lysholm score of 24 increased to 85 postoperatively. Mean IKDC score was 56.3 preoperatively and 84.5 postoperatively. The mean Tegner score of 3.4 increased to 5.6 postoperatively. Mean Lysholm, IKDC, and Tegner scores in the first group were 84, 74, and 5.1, respectively, and in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction group; 86, 85.9, and 5.8. While 20 (77%) out of 26 patients had none of the clinical findings, 6 patients (23%) presented with these findings. Postoperative MRI assessment revealed meniscal healing in 21 patients (27% complete, 54% partial healing) and no healing in 5 patients (19%). A clinical healing rate of 77% and a radiological healing rate of 81% along with statistically significant increases in Lysholm, IKDC, and Tegner scores prove that the repair option is effective for neglected, chronic bucket-handle meniscal tears flipping to the intercondylar notch. This study showed that good results could be achieved with the repair of neglected, chronic period bucket-handle meniscal tears flipping to the intercondylar notch, whether with an accompanying ACL tear or not.

TI  - Correlation between quantitative pivot shift and generalized joint laxity: a prospective multicenter study of ACL ruptures.
PY  - 2017
AB  - To investigate whether an increased magnitude of quantitative rotatory knee laxity is associated with a greater level of generalized joint laxity in ACL-injured and contralateral knees. A total of 103 patients were enrolled across four international centers to undergo anatomic ACL reconstruction. Rotatory knee laxity was evaluated preoperatively, both in the awake state and under anesthesia, using the standardized pivot shift test. Two devices were used to quantify rotatory knee laxity; an inertial sensor, measuring the joint acceleration, and an image analysis system, measuring the lateral compartment translation of the tibia. The presence of generalized joint laxity was determined using the Beighton Hypermobility Score. The correlation between the level of generalized joint laxity and the magnitude of rotatory knee laxity was calculated for both the involved knee and the non-involved knee. Further, patients were dichotomized into low (0–4) or high (5–9) Beighton Score groups. Alpha was set at < 0.05. Ninety-six patients had complete datasets, 83 and 13 in the low and high Beighton Score groups respectively. In anesthetized patients, there was a significant correlation between the degree of Beighton Score and quantitative pivot shift when analyzing the non-involved knee using the image analysis system (r = 0.235, p < 0.05). When analyzing the same knee, multivariate analysis adjusted for meniscal injury, age and gender revealed an increased odds ratio for patients with increased lateral compartment translation to be part of the high Beighton Score group (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.10–3.17, p < 0.05). No other correlation was significant. When analyzing the dichotomized subgroups, no significant correlations could be established. The findings in this study suggest that there is a weak correlation between generalized joint laxity and the contralateral healthy knee, indicating increased rotatory knee laxity in these patients. Generalized joint laxity does not appear to correlate with rotatory knee laxity in ACL-injured knees. Prospective cohort study; level of evidence, 2.

TI  - Lateral Collateral Ligament and Biceps Femoris Tendon Fixation with a Suture Anchor to the Tibial Metaphysis after Proximal Fibula En Bloc Resections Preserve Lateral Knee Stability.
PY  - 2022
AB  - This study aims to analyze the functional outcomes and lateral knee stability of patients who underwent lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and biceps femoris tendon reconstruction with suture anchors after proximal fibula en bloc resection for bone tumors. Patients who underwent proximal fibular en bloc resection between 2007 and 2018 were retrospectively viewed. Patients were invited to visit the clinic, and their functional scores were evaluated using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Scoring (MSTS) system. Lateral knee stability was evaluated by varus stress radiographs obtained at 20 degrees of flexion, and the range of motion (ROM) of the bilateral knee was assessed. Side-to-side differences were graded according to the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) criteria and compared between types I and II resections. A total of 17 patients (4 males and 13 females) with a mean age of 31.1 ± 17.1 (range: 13-65) years at the time of surgery were available for radiological and clinical examination at a mean follow-up of 68.6 ± 36.4 (range: 22-124) months after surgery. In terms of ROM measurements, IKDC grades and side-to-side differences in both flexion and extension were not significantly different between the groups. On varus stress radiographs, lateral knee gapping was measured to be 0.93 ± 0.91 mm in type-I resections and 1.83 ± 0.45 mm in type-II resections, and statistically significant differences were detected among the groups (<i>p</i> = 0.039). When the values were graded according to IKDC criteria, none of the knees were classified as abnormal, and no difference was observed between the groups. Mean MSTS score of patients with type-I resections was significantly higher than those of patients with type-II resections (92.7 vs. 84.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.021). In the subscale analysis, a significant difference was observed in the support scores (type I = 94.5%, type II = 70%; <i>p</i> = 0.001). The reattachment of LCL and biceps femoris tendon to the tibial metaphysis with a suture anchor is a simple and effective method to prevent lateral knee instability after proximal fibula resections.

TI  - Outcomes of Revision ACL
PY  - 2013
AB  - The outcome of revision ACL surgery is generally considered less successful than primary ACL reconstruction. Revision surgery is technically more challenging due to many factors including limitations in graft choice, placement of previous bone tunnels, other concomitant knee injuries, chronicity of instability, possible development of degenerative changes, adhesions, and many others. Return to sport following revision surgery is also affected by these factors and is less predictable than in the primary setting. Stability can generally be restored, but the long-term function of the knee following revision reconstruction ultimately can be limited due to degenerative lesions and the onset of arthritis.

TI  - Morphological changes in the femoral and tibial bone tunnels after anatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a calcium phosphate-hybridized tendon graft in 2 years of follow-up
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Introduction A calcium phosphate (CaP)-hybridized tendon graft improves tendon-to-bone healing. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the progression of morphological changes in the femoral and tibial bone tunnels after anatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the CaP-hybridized tendon graft versus an untreated tendon graft during 2 years of follow-up. Hypothesis We hypothesized that the CaP-hybridized tendon graft would prevent the progression of bone tunnel enlargement compared with the untreated tendon graft. Patients and methods The CaP group comprised 19 patients, while the conventional group comprised 18. Computed tomography was performed at postoperative 1 week, 1 year, and 2 years. The bone tunnel enlargement and tunnel translation at the aperture of the femoral and tibial tunnels were analyzed. Results In the CaP group, the femoral bone tunnel did not expand during 2 years of follow-up. In the conventional group, the femoral bone tunnel diameters at postoperative 1 year and 2 years were enlarged compared with postoperative 1 week, and the proximal and distal walls of the femoral bone tunnel shifted proximally and distally, respectively. The femoral bone tunnel in the CaP group was smaller than that in the conventional group at 1 year postoperatively. Although the tibial bone tunnels expanded for up to 1 year postoperatively in both groups, the expanded bone tunnel reduced during 2 years of follow-up only in the CaP group. Discussion In anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction, the femoral bone tunnel in the CaP group did not expand or progress with time compared with the conventional group, while the tibial bone tunnel in the CaP group expanded for up to 1 year postoperatively and then reduced for up to 2 years postoperatively. The CaP-hybridized tendon can prevent the progression of bone tunnel enlargement. Level of evidence Level II, Low-powered prospective randomized trial.

TI  - Posterolateral Corner Reconstruction Using the Anatomical Two-Tailed Graft Technique: Clinical Outcomes in the Multiligament Injured Knee.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Injury to the posterolateral corner (PLC) of the knee can lead to both varus and rotational instability. Multiple PLC reconstruction techniques have been described, including one-tailed graft (fibula-based constructs) or two-tailed graft (combined fibula- and tibia-based constructs). The purpose of our study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of anatomical two-tailed graft reconstruction of the PLC in the setting of multiligament knee injuries (MKLIs) with grade III varus instability. Patients were identified through a prospective MLKI database between 2004 and 2013. Patients who received fibular collateral ligament and PLC reconstructions using a two-tailed graft and had a minimum follow-up of 2 years were included. Patients were assessed for clinical laxity grade, range of motion, and functional outcomes using Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores. Twenty patients (16 male, 4 female) with a mean age of 30.7 (range: 16–52) and a mean follow-up of 52.2 months (range: 24–93 months) were included. Knee dislocation (KD) grades included: 4 KD-1, 10 KD 3-L, 5 KD-4, and 1 KD-5. No patients had isolated PLC injuries. Mean IKDC and Lysholm score were 73.1 ± 25.8 and 78 ± 26, respectively. Mean range of motion was –1.1 to 122.8. In full extension, two patients (10%) had grade 1 laxity to varus stress. In 30 degrees of knee flexion, five (25%) patients had grade 1 laxity, and two (10%) had grade 2 laxity. Anatomical two-tailed PLC reconstruction can reliably restore varus stability when performed on patients with MLKIs and type C posterolateral instability with hyperextension external rotation recurvatum deformity. Satisfactory functional outcome scores were achieved in the majority of patients. This study supports the use of an anatomical two-tailed PLC reconstruction in the multiligament injured knee. The level of evidence is IV, case series.

TI  - Patellar subluxation at terminal knee extension: isolated deficiency of the medial patellomeniscal ligament.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: The medial patellomeniscal ligament has been determined in vitro to be the only substantial distal-medial restraint to lateral patellar displacement. The purpose of this study of prospectively collected data was to determine if isolated deficiency of the medial patellomeniscal ligament, resulting in excessive lateral patellar translation and associated symptoms, could be identified. We hypothesized that, if symptoms were associated with isolated deficiency of that ligament, the laxity and symptoms should resolve after plication of that ligament alone.

Methods: Testing for lateral patellar displacement in the extended knee by exertion of force through the distal patellar attachment of the medial patellomeniscal ligament was performed on 745 patients with patellofemoral syndromes during a twenty-eight-month period. In addition, the ability to recognize pathologically increased lateral patellar translation preoperatively with use of such testing was compared with the ability to recognize increased lateral translation with testing in 439 patients undergoing arthroscopy under anesthesia during that period for any reason. Preoperative symptoms and impairment in knees with isolated deficiency of the medial patellomeniscal ligament were documented and compared with the postoperative results.

Results: Isolated medial patellomeniscal ligament deficiency was identified with testing under anesthesia in twenty-three of the 439 knees undergoing arthroscopy for any reason, and twenty of those twenty-three cases had been detected preoperatively with use of lateral patellar displacement testing. Isolated medial patellomeniscal ligament plication was performed in these twenty-three cases, and follow-up data at a mean of 30.8 months were available for twenty-one of the cases. The mean International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score increased from 38.9 preoperatively to 84.6 postoperatively, and recurrent symptomatic pathological lateral patellar translation was present in only one patient.

Conclusions: Isolated deficiency of the medial patellomeniscal ligament can be detected by physical examination. Restoration of the normal length of the ligament by plication can lead to resolution of detectable patellar subluxation and its associated symptoms.

TI  - The outcome at 15 years of endoscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring tendon autograft for ‘isolated’ anterior cruciate ligament rupture
PY  - 2012
AB  - The purpose of this study was to report the outcome of ‘isolated’ anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures treated with anatomical endoscopic reconstruction using hamstring tendon autograft at a mean of 15 years (14.25 to 16.9). A total of 100 consecutive men and 100 consecutive women with ‘isolated’ ACL rupture underwent four-strand hamstring tendon reconstruction with anteromedial portal femoral tunnel drilling and interference screw fixation by a single surgeon. Details were recorded pre-operatively and at one, two, seven and 15 years post-operatively. Outcomes included clinical examination, subjective and objective scoring systems, and radiological assessment. At 15 years only eight of 118 patients (7%) had moderate or severe osteo-arthritic changes (International Knee Documentation Committee Grades C and D), and 79 of 152 patients (52%) still performed very strenuous activities. Overall graft survival at 15 years was 83% (1.1% failure per year). Patients aged 2 mm of laxity at one year had a threefold increase in the risk of suffering a rupture of the graft (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively). There was no increase in laxity of the graft over time.

ACL reconstructive surgery in patients with an ‘isolated’ rupture using this technique shows good results 15 years post-operatively with respect to ligamentous stability, objective and subjective outcomes, and does not appear to cause osteoarthritis.

TI  - Quality of Life and Clinical Outcome Comparison of Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendon Versus Patellar Tendon Autografts for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction An 11-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Controlled Trial
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: There are still controversies about graft selection for primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Prospective, randomized long-term studies are needed to determine the differences between the graft materials.Hypothesis: Eleven years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction there is no difference in functional outcome and quality of life between patients with patellar tendon or hamstring tendon autografts; however, the patients with patellar tendon autograft would have a higher prevalence of osteoarthritis.Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.Methods: From June 1999 to March 2000, 64 patients were included in this prospective study. A single surgeon performed primary arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in an alternating sequence. In 32 patients, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed with hamstring tendon autograft (semitendinosus and gracilis [STG] group) while in the other 32 patients the reconstructio...

TI  - Translation and Validation of the Korean Version of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose: To perform a cross-cultural adaptation and to test the measurement properties of the Korean version of International Knee Documentation Committee (K-IKDC) Subjective Knee Form. Materials and Methods: According to the guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation, translation and backward translation of the English version of the IKDC Subjective Knee Form were performed. After translation into the Korean version, 150 patients who had knee-related problems were asked to complete the K-IKDC, Lysholm score, and Short Form-36 (SF-36). Of these patients, 126 were retested 2 weeks later to evaluate test-retest reliability, and 104 were recruited 3 months later to evaluate responsiveness. Construct validity was analyzed by investigating the correlation with Lysholm score and SF-36; content validity was also evaluated. Standardized mean response was calculated for evaluating responsiveness. Results: The test-retest reliability proved excellent with a high value for the intraclass correlation coefficient (r=0.94). The internal consistency was strong (Cronbach`s α=0.91). Good content validity with absence of floor not ceiling effects and good convergent and divergent validity were observed. Moderate responsiveness was shown (standardized mean response=0.689). Conclusions: The K-IKDC demonstrated good measurement properties. We suggest that this instrument is an excellent evaluation instrument that can be used for Korean patients with knee-related injuries.

TI  - Anterior cruciate ligament replacement: comparison of bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts with two-strand hamstring grafts. A prospective, randomized study.
PY  - 2002
AB  - Background: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate replacement of a torn anterior cruciate ligament with either a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft or a two-strand semitendinosus-gracilis autograft to compare the results of clinical testing, patient satisfaction, activity level, functional status, and muscle strength.

Methods: Fifty-six patients with a torn anterior cruciate ligament were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Twenty-eight underwent reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft, and twenty-eight were treated with a two-strand semitendinosus-gracilis autograft. Patients were followed for an average of thirty-nine months (range, thirty-six to fifty-seven months). At the time of final follow-up, twenty-two patients in each group were evaluated in terms of clinical test findings, patient satisfaction, activity level, functional status, and isokinetic muscle strength.

Results: The objective outcome of replacement of the torn anterior cruciate ligament with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft was superior to that obtained with a two-strand semitendinosus-gracilis graft. At the three-year follow-up interval, the patients in whom a hamstring graft had been used had an average of 4.4 mm of increased anterior knee laxity compared with the laxity of the contralateral, normal knee, whereas the patients in whom a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft had been used had an average of 1.1 mm of increased knee laxity. Fourteen percent (three) of the twenty-two patients with a hamstring graft had a mild pivot shift, and 27% (six) had a moderate pivot shift. Only 14% (three) of the twenty-two patients with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft had a mild pivot shift, and none had a moderate pivot shift. At the same follow-up interval, the patients in whom a hamstring graft had been used had significantly lower peak knee-flexion strength than those who had a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (p = 0.039). In contrast, the two treatments produced similar outcomes in terms of patient satisfaction, activity level, and knee function (ability to perform a one-legged hop, bear weight, squat, climb stairs, run in place, and duckwalk).

Conclusions: After three years of follow-up, the objective results of anterior cruciate ligament replacement with a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft were superior to those of replacement with a two-strand semitendinosus-gracilis graft with regard to knee laxity, pivot-shift grade, and strength of the knee flexor muscles. However, the two groups had comparable results in terms of patient satisfaction, activity level, and knee function.

TI  - The subjective knee value is a valid single-item survey to assess knee function in common knee disorders.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The patient’s perspective plays a key role in judging the effect of knee disorders on physical function. We have introduced the Subjective Knee Value (SKV) to simplify the evaluation of individual’s knee function by providing one simple question. The purpose of this prospective study was to validate the SKV with accepted multiple-item knee surveys across patients with orthopaedic knee disorders. Between January through March 2020, consecutive patients (n = 160; mean age 51 ± 18 years, range from 18 to 85 years, 54% women) attending the outpatient clinic for knee complaints caused by osteoarthritis (n = 69), meniscal lesion (n = 45), tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (n = 23) and focal chondral defect (n = 23) were invited to complete a knee-specific survey including the SKV along with the Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form (IKDC-S). The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate external validity between the SKV and each patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) separately. Furthermore, patient’s compliance was assessed by comparing responding rates. Overall, the SKV highly correlated with both the KOOS (R = 0.758, p < 0.05) and the IKDC-S (R = 0.802, p < 0.05). This was also demonstrated across all investigated diagnosis- and demographic-specific (gender, age) subgroups (range 0.509–0.936). No relevant floor/ceiling effects were noticed. The responding rate for the SKV (96%) was significantly higher when compared with those for the KOOS (81%) and the IKDC-S (83%) (p < 0.05). At baseline, the SKV exhibits acceptable validity across all investigated knee-specific PROMs in a broad patient population with a wide array of knee disorders. The simplified survey format without compromising the precision to evaluate individual’s knee function justifies implementation in daily clinical practice. II, cohort study (diagnosis).

TI  - A meta-analysis of measurement properties of the Western Ontario Meniscal Evaluation Tool (WOMET).
PY  - 2020
AB  - We provide a meta-analysis for clinicians and researchers regarding the psychometric properties of the WOMET as a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for patients with meniscal pathologies. A comprehensive literature search identified 6 eligible papers evaluating WOMET measurement properties in patients with different meniscal injuries and meniscal treatments following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the four-point Consensus-based Standard for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) Checklist for good measurement properties. The checklist was specifically developed for studies on health-related PROMs. Our meta-analysis suggests that the WOMET can be used to evaluate patients with different meniscal injuries and meniscal treatments, especially acute or chronic meniscal injuries and traumatic or degenerative meniscal injuries treated operatively or conservatively. The WOMET shows satisfactory internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity. Due to limitations in both sample sizes and methodologies of the included studies, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the WOMET’s content validity, structure validity, cross-cultural validity, measurement error, or responsiveness. A further limitation of the studies included in this meta-analysis is the lack of cross-cultural validation, although recommended by the COSMIN Standards. The first meta-analysis on measurement properties of the WOMET demonstrates satisfactory internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity. Further studies are needed, focusing on the methodological deficiencies highlighted in this meta-analysis. To ensure that the WOMET adequately reflects the symptoms, functions, and quality of life of patients with meniscal tears based on COSMIN criteria, it is necessary to assess the structural validity and content validity of this PROM.

TI  - Correlation Analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Graft Maturity and Outcomes After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using International Knee Documentation Committee Score.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Objective The correlation between the signal/noise quotient values of an anterior cruciate ligament graft and the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form 2000 scores after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was evaluated. Design Magnetic resonance imaging and clinical evaluation using International Knee Documentation Committee scores were used to calculate the signal intensity of the graft maturity at the 6-mo and 12-mo follow-up points postoperatively. The associations between the signal/noise quotient values at the 6-mo follow-up point and International Knee Documentation Committee scores at the 12-mo follow-up point were evaluated. Results A total of 42 male patients completed our trial and returned to normal activity level before the surgery. The mean ± SD age of these patients was 29.07 ± 8.11 yrs (range, 17-47 yrs). The mean ± SD body mass index was 26.00 ± 2.59 kg/m. Notably, the Pearson correlation analysis showed that the International Knee Documentation Committee scores obtained at 12 mos were significantly associated with the signal/noise quotient values measured in the sixth month and twelfth month, respectively (r = -0.454, P = 0.003; r = -0.478, P = 0.001). Conclusions According to this study, early measurement of graft maturity might predict the clinical outcome afterward. The sensitive predictive value of signal/noise quotient could be used to maximize the patient outcomes.

TI  - Combined Intra-articular and Extra-articular Reconstruction in Anterior Cruciate Ligament–Deficient Knee: 25 Years Later
PY  - 2016
AB  - Purpose To determine whether an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)–reconstructed knee with hamstring autograft has a greater incidence of degenerative changes when an extra-articular reconstruction is added and to determine the effect of the combined reconstruction on knee stability and function at long-term follow-up. Methods For this retrospective study, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between January 2002 and December 2003 were selected and classified into 2 groups, I and II. Group I consisted of patients operated by a standard ACL reconstruction, and group II consisted of patients in whom, owing to the presence of risk factors (severe pivot shift graded +++ or high-risk sports), an extra-articular reconstruction performed with ileo-tibial tract according to McIntosh as modified by Cocker Arnold technique, was used in conjunction with intra-articular ACL reconstruction. At final follow-up, Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner scores were used. An arthrometric KT-1000 evaluation was done. Comparative weight-bearing radiographs were taken, including a skyline view for the patellofemoral joint and analyzed according to Fairbank, Kellgren, and IKDC classification. Results Seventy-two of the 75 (96%) patients in group I and 68 of the 75 patients in group II were available at the final follow-up (minimum 10 years). Subjective scores improved significantly in both groups, with no significant difference. Objectively, the number of patients receiving C and D IKDC objective activity scores in group I (7/56; 12.5%) was significantly higher than in group II (0/60) ( P  = .01). Considering as a failure a side-to-side arthrometric difference more than 5 mm or a pivot shift test graded as ++ or +++, or any giving way episode occurring postoperatively, we found 8 cases in group I and no cases in group II ( P  = .01) despite the presence of risk factors that group I did not include. Radiologic evaluation showed less arthritic changes in group II in both tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints. Conclusions On the basis of the results of this study, adding an extra-articular reconstruction to an anatomically placed intra-articular ACL reconstruction, followed by a modern rehabilitation protocol, does not increase the risk of osteoarthritis and may be able to reduce the rate of failure. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative study.

TI  - Does chronic medial collateral ligament laxity influence the outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction?: a prospective evaluation with a minimum three-year follow-up.
PY  - 2011
AB  - We have shown in a previous study that patients with combined lesions of the anterior cruciate (ACL) and medial collateral ligaments (MCL) had similar anteroposterior (AP) but greater valgus laxity at 30° after reconstruction of the ACL when compared with patients who had undergone reconstruction of an isolated ACL injury. The present study investigated the same cohort of patients after a minimum of three years to evaluate whether the residual valgus laxity led to a poorer clinical outcome. Each patient had undergone an arthroscopic double-bundle ACL reconstruction using a semitendinosus-gracilis graft. In the combined ACL/MCL injury group, the grade II medial collateral ligament injury was not treated. At follow-up, AP laxity was measured using a KT-2000 arthrometer, while valgus laxity was evaluated with Telos valgus stress radiographs and compared with the uninjured knee. We evaluated clinical outcome scores, muscle girth and time to return to activities for the two groups. Valgus stress radiographs showed statistically significant greater mean medial joint opening in the reconstructed compared with the uninjured knees (1.7 mm (SD 0.9) versus 0.9 mm (SD 0.7), respectively, p = 0.013), while no statistically significant difference was found between the AP laxity and the other clinical parameters. Our results show that the residual valgus laxity does not affect AP laxity significantly at a minimum follow up of three years, suggesting that no additional surgical procedure is needed for the medial collateral ligament in combined lesions.

TI  - Surgical management of knee dislocations with ligament reconstruction associated with a hinged external fixator.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract Introduction Knee dislocations are defined as ligament injuries involving at least two of the four most important knee ligaments. Results from recent studies have shown a tendency towards improvement of the functional outcomes with use of an articulated external fixator during the postoperative period following multiligament reconstruction. Our hypothesis was that good knee stability and early gain of range of motion could be achieved with the use of the external fixator after ligament reconstructions. Methods Fourteen patients with knee dislocations were evaluated after multiligament reconstruction in association with use of a lateral monoplanar external fixator for six weeks. Reconstructions were performed using grafts from a tissue bank. Range of motion was measured after one, two, three, six, twelve months and at the final evaluation at a mean time of 49 months. The assessments were made using objective and subjective IKDC, Lysholm and Tegner scales. Results The mean scores were 71.7 for the subjective IKDC score, 81.5 for the Lysholm score. No patient was able to return to previous Tegner score. Out of the 45 ligament reconstructions performed, only four failed during the follow-up time. The mean range of motion of the knee presented a progressive increase from the first to the twelfth month, from 67.8° to 115.7°. Two cases of superficial infection on the site of the external fixator pins were observed. Conclusion The use of an external fixator enabled early rehabilitation with range of motion gains starting from the first postoperative month, a low rate of reconstruction failure and minimal complications. Nevertheless, none of the patients returned to the level of activity prevailing prior to the injury. Level of evidence Level IV, retrospective therapeutic case series.

TI  - Does Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Improve Functional and Radiographic Outcomes Over Nonoperative Management 5 Years After Injury
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background:Current practice patterns for the management of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury favor surgical reconstruction. However, long-term outcomes may not differ between patients completing operative and nonoperative treatment of ACL injury. Differences in outcomes between operative and nonoperative treatment of patients in the United States is largely unknown, as are outcomes in long-term strength and performance measures.Purpose:To determine if differences exist in 5-year functional and radiographic outcomes between patients completing operative and nonoperative treatment of ACL injury when both groups complete a progressive criterion-based rehabilitation protocol.Study Design:Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.Methods:From an original group of 144 athletes, 105 participants (mean ± SD age, 34.3 ± 11.4 years) with an acute ACL rupture completed functional testing (quadriceps strength, single-legged hop, and knee joint effusion testing; patient-reported outcomes) and knee radiographs 5 years a...

TI  - Arthroscopic medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction with polyethylene suture combined with medial retinaculum plication for the treatment of acute patellar dislocation in young and middle-aged patients with a follow-up of at least 2 years.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The purpose of this study was to propose a surgical technique for arthroscopic medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction with polyethylene suture combined with medial retinaculum plication and to evaluate the efficacy of this surgical technique in the treatment of acute patellar dislocation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Clinical data of patients with acute patellar dislocations treated with arthroscopic MPFL reconstruction with polyethylene tape (FiberTape) combined with medial support band compression were analyzed retrospectively from January 2018 to January 2021. The mean age of the patients was 25.15 ± 4.66 years; the mean follow-up time was 27.5 (24-36) months. Clinical evaluation consisted of apprehension test results, patellar extrapolation test results, Lysholm score, Kujala score, and IKDC score, the Patellar lateral shift distance and patellar tilt angle (PTA) measured by CT scan.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">All patients had no recurrent patellar dislocation or subluxation after surgery, and the apprehension test was negative. In all patients, the Kujala score (36.0 ± 9.9 vs. 98.2 ± 3.1), the IKDC score (48.6 ± 7.0 vs. 90.6 ± 4.4) and the Lysholm score (32.8 ± 10.4 vs. 96.7 ± 3.1) had improved at the 24-month follow up (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, PTA was significantly lower at the 12-month follow-up and 24-giving-month follow-up compared to the preoperative period (P &lt; 0.05, Table 2). The patellar lateral shift distance decreased from 14.94 ± 6.11 mm preoperatively to 3.00 ± 1.40 mm (12-month follow up) and 3.26 ± 1.37 mm (24-month follow up), respectively.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Arthroscopic MPFL reconstruction with polyethylene suture combined with medial retinaculum plication is a safe and reliable surgical technique for the treatment of acute patellar dislocation in young and middle-aged patients.</AbstractText>

TI  - Arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation of a medial femoral condylar fracture after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. A case report.
PY  - 2008
AB  - More than 100,000 anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction operations are performed annually in the United States1. Autogenous bone-patellar tendon-bone graft is the most frequent graft option used. The reported prevalence of complications varies widely, and serious complications include infection, stiffness, graft failure, deep venous thrombosis, tendon rupture, osteonecrosis, and periarticular fracture2-6. Periarticular fractures associated with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction have been reported and include patellar, tibial plateau, tibial tubercle, and lateral femoral condylar and supracondylar femoral fracture patterns. Patellar fracture has been the most commonly documented postoperative fracture complication and occurs in conjunction with the harvesting of autogenous bone-patellar tendon-bone graft7,8. Additionally, eight tibial fractures9-16 and eight lateral condylar or supracondylar femoral fractures associated with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction have been reported17-24. These fractures occurred through iatrogenic stress-risers25,26 created at the time of reconstruction, and the reported treatment had been arthrotomy with open reduction and internal fixation.

To our knowledge, the case of our patient represents the first published report of medial femoral condylar fracture occurring after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and the first report of the use of arthroscopically assisted medial femoral condylar reduction and percutaneous internal fixation. Arthroscopically assisted reduction with internal fixation of a displaced lateral condylar fracture has been reported rarely27-29; however, to our knowledge, a similar approach to a medial condylar fracture has not been reported.

In the case of our patient, the mechanism of injury causing the medial femoral condylar fracture appeared to be the direct impact onto the medial femoral condyle of a flexed knee during a fall. Similar to the other reported femoral fracture patterns, this fracture occurred through the femoral tunnel stress-riser that had been created during …

TI  - The Addition of the Gracilis Tendon to a Semitendinosus Tendon Autograft Is Not Associated With Knee Muscle Strength, Subjective Knee Function, or Revision Surgery After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">To evaluate and compare isokinetic knee muscle (extension and flexion) strength, single-leg hop (SLH) test performance, anterior knee laxity, subjective knee function, and the 2-year revision surgery risk between patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with semitendinosus tendon (ST) autografts and patients who underwent ACLR with ST and gracilis tendon (ST-G) autografts.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">We identified patients aged 16 years or older who underwent primary ACLR with hamstring tendon autografts at our institution from January 2005 to December 2020 and had no associated ligament injuries. Isokinetic knee muscle strength and SLH test performance were assessed 6 months postoperatively. Anterior knee laxity (KT-1000 arthrometer, 134 N) was assessed preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was collected preoperatively and 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Patients who underwent revision ACLR at any institution in Sweden within 2 years of primary surgery were identified through the Swedish National Knee Ligament Registry.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">A total of 6,974 patients (5,479 with ST and 1,495 with ST-G) were included. There were no significant differences in extension and flexion strength or SLH test performance between the groups. Preoperatively, there was no significant difference in knee laxity between the ST and ST-G groups. Postoperatively, the ST-G group had significantly increased mean side-to-side (STS) laxity (2.1 ± 2.3 mm vs 1.7 ± 2.2 mm, P &lt; .001) and showed a trend toward increased STS laxity according to the International Knee Documentation Committee form, with significantly fewer patients with STS laxity of 2 mm or less (58.4% vs 65.8%) and significantly more patients with STS laxity between 3 and 5 mm (35.0% vs 29.9%) or greater than 5 mm (6.6% vs 4.3%) (P &lt; .001). The only significant difference in subjective knee function was for the KOOS Quality of Life subscale score in favor of the ST group preoperatively (37.3 ± 21.4 vs 35.1 ± 19.9, P = .001). No other significant differences between the groups were found preoperatively and 1 and 2 years postoperatively for any of the KOOS subscales. The overall revision ACLR rate within 2 years of primary surgery was 2.0% (138 of 6,974 patients). The revision ACLR risk in the ST-G group (1.7%, 25 of 1,495 patients) was not significantly different from that in the ST group (2.1%, 113 of 5,479 patients) (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-1.24; P = .32).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">The addition of the gracilis tendon to an ST autograft was not associated with knee muscle strength, SLH test performance, subjective knee function, or the risk of revision surgery after ACLR.</AbstractText>

TI  - Les grilles d'évaluations dans la ligamentoplastie du LCA Rating scores for ACL ligamentoplasty
PY  - 2004
AB  - Introduction. – Recently, results of surgery for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) have been systematically assessed. Several scales have been developed, but for most rigorous validation is lacking. Methodology. – We reviewed reports of published scales for ACL surgery and compared their psychometric properties. We searched the MedLine and Cochrane databases with the key words anterior cruciate ligament, surgery, and rating score. A scale was reviewed if its reliability, validity, and responsiveness were reported at least once. Results. – We reviewed four scales (Lysholm and Tegner, Cincinnatti, IKDC , and Koos). Test–retest reliability was good, except for the IKDC. For all scales, construct validity could not been ascertained. Responsiveness was acceptable and of the same magnitude for the Lysholm and Tegner, and Cincinnatti scales. Conclusion. – None of the scales had sufficient psychometric properties and all seemed too complicated for routine use. Validation of a simple scale is needed. Psychometric properties of the last version of the IKDC (IKDC 2000) and the Cincinnatti scales should be studied. © 2004 Publie par Elsevier SAS.

TI  - Injuries of the medial side of the knee : When and how should they be treated?
PY  - 2023
AB  - Different medial structures are responsible for restraining valgus rotation, external rotation, and anteromedial rotation. When injured this can result in various degrees of isolated and combined instabilities. In contrast to earlier speculation, the posterior oblique ligament (POL) is no longer considered to be the main stabilizer of anteromedial rotatory instability (AMRI). Acute proximal medial ruptures are typically managed conservatively with very good clinical results. Conversely, acute distal ruptures usually require a surgical intervention. Chronic instabilities mostly occur in combination with instabilities of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The clinical examination is a particularly important component in these cases to determine the indications for surgery for an additional medial reconstruction. In cases of severe medial and anteromedial instabilities, surgical treatment should be considered. Biomechanically, a combined medial and anteromedial reconstruction appears to be superior to other reconstruction methods; however, there is currently a lack of clinical studies to confirm this biomechanical advantage.

AB  - Resume Les auteurs ont evalue au recul moyen de 5,2 ans une serie continue de 50 patients sportifs en pivots repares dans les 8 premiers jours d’une rupture isolee du LCA selon la technique de MacIntosh modifiee utilisant le tractus iliotibial. La section de la cloison intermusculaire laterale a permis une reconstitution du hauban lateral tout en prelevant une bandelette de 40 a 45 mm de largeur. Les resultats globaux selon la fiche de cotation IKDC ont ete comparables a ceux d’autres auto-transplants : 38 % (IKDC A), 46 % (B), 12 % (C), 4 % (D). La laxite residuelle differentielle moyenne a ete mesuree a l’arthrometre KT-1000 a 1,86±1,74 mm. Quarante-huit pour cent des genoux ne presentaient pas de signe de Lachman. Les ressauts ont ete neutralises dans 88 % des cas. Selon les criteres de la fiche de cotation Arpege, nous avons observe 38 % de resultats excellents, 46 % de bons resultats, 12 % de resultats moyens et 4 % de mauvais resultats. Trente-trois patients sur 50 ont conserve au recul le meme niveau d’activite sportive. Un echec anatomique precoce et deux cas de ruptures iteratives traumatiques sont survenus a 25 et 38 mois de recul. Deux flexum irreductibles de plus de +5 et trois deficits en flexion superieurs a 20 ont altere les resultats fonctionnels. Une competitrice ayant pu reprendre ses activites sportives a eu une mobilisation de son genou sous anesthesie generale. Un seul cas de hernie musculaire par dehiscence a ete observe au niveau de la zone prelevee. Le deficit residuel moyen quadricipital a ete a 12 mois de 10 % a 90/s et celui des ischio-jambiers de 1,3 % a la meme vitesse.

TI  - Multiligament knee injuries treated by one-stage reconstruction using allograft: Postoperative laxity assessment using stress radiography and clinical outcomes
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Background Surgical treatment of multiligament knee injuries (MLKIs) leads to better outcomes but there are controversies about optimal surgical strategies. Debates remain about timing of surgery: acute, staged or delayed and about graft choice: autograft, allograft or a combination of both. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study aiming to evaluate postoperative laxity using stress radiographs and clinical outcomes after one-stage reconstructions of injured ligaments using non-irradiated, fresh-frozen allografts. Hypothesis MLKIs treated by one-stage reconstructions using non-irradiated, fresh-frozen allograft may lead to satisfactorily postoperative laxity and clinical outcomes. Methods Between November 2013 and July 2015, 23 patients with MLKIs underwent one-stage reconstruction using allograft. Knee injuries were defined according Schenk classification of Knee Dislocation (KD). Patients were evaluated using the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form at a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Postoperative anterior, posterior, varus, and valgus laxities were assessed using stress radiographs and expressed as side-to-side differences (SSD) in millimeters. Results Three of 23 patients were lost to follow-up. There were 6 KD-I, 12 KD-III, and 2 KD-IV lesions, 12 lateral-side and 10 medial-side lesions, and 13 acute and 7 chronic cases. Three patients had associated neurovascular injuries. Mean follow-up was at 29.4 ± 6.1 months. Mean valgus SSD was 0.2 mm ± 1.4 mm (range, −2.1–2.2 mm), mean varus SSD was 1.4 mm ± 2.5 mm (range, −1.7 – 6.0 mm), mean posterior SSD was 7.2 mm ± 3.9 mm (range, 1.2 – 16.0 mm), mean anterior SSD was 3.6 mm ± 5.1 mm (range, − 4.8 – 16.8 mm). Overall IKDC ratings were: 4 grade A, 3B, 7C, and 6D. Three patients complained of postoperative instability, with an IKDC rating of D. The mean subjective IKDC score was 67.2 ± 19.6, the mean Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale was 77.3 ± 16.5, and the mean KOOS results were 78.5 ± 16.6 for pain, 67.7 ± 17.4 for symptoms, 86.5 ± 14.2 for daily activities, 56 ± 25.4 for sports, and 47.2 ± 28.6 for quality of life. Nineteen of 20 patients returned to sport—6 to the same level. One patient underwent an arthroscopic arthrolysis due to postoperative arthrofibrosis. Conclusions Using non-irradiated allografts for one-stage reconstructions of all the injured ligaments in MLKIs is effective and safe. Anteroposterior stability was difficult to restore, but patients returned to their daily activities and sometimes to their sports activity at the same preinjury level. Level of evidence Level IV, case series.

TI  - Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft.
PY  - 1999
AB  - Background Surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is indicated in the ACL-deficient knee with symptomatic instability and multiple ligaments injuries. Bone patellar tendon-bone and the hamstring tendon generally have been used. In the present study, we describe an alternative graft, the quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft, by using arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Methods From March of 1996 through March of 1997, a quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft was used in 12 patients with ACL injuries. Results After 15 to 24 months of follow-up, the clinical outcome for those patients with this graft have been encouraging. Ten patients could return to the same or a higher level of preinjury sports activity. According to the International Knee Documentation Committee rating system, 10 of the 12 patients had normal or nearly normal ratings. Recovery of quadriceps muscle strength to 80% of the normal knee was achieved in 11 patients in 1 year. Conclusion The advantages of the quadriceps tendon graft include the following: the graft is larger and stronger than the patellar tendon; morbidity of harvest technique and donor site is less than that of patellar tendon graft; there is little quadriceps inhibition after quadriceps harvest; there is quicker return to sports activities with aggressive rehabilitation. A quadriceps tendon-patellar autograft is a reasonable alternative to ACL reconstruction in patients who are not suitable for either a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft or a hamstring tendon autograft.

TI  - Knee Hyperextension Greater Than 5° Is a Risk Factor for Failure in ACL Reconstruction Using Hamstring Graft.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background The degree of knee hyperextension in isolation has not been studied in detail as a risk factor that could lead to increased looseness or graft failure after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Purpose To analyze whether more than 5° of passive knee hyperextension is associated with worse functional outcomes and greater risk of graft failure after primary ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autograft. Study Design Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods A cohort of patients who had primary ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autografts was divided into 2 groups based on passive contralateral knee hyperextension greater than 5° (hyperextension group) and less than 5° (control group) of hyperextension. Groups were matched by age, sex, and associated meniscal tears. The following data were collected and compared between the groups: patient data (age and sex), time from injury to surgery, passive knee hyperextension, KT-1000 arthrometer laxity, pivot shift, associated meniscal injury and treatment (meniscectomy or repair), contralateral knee ligament injury, intra-articular graft size, follow-up time, occurrence of graft failure, and postoperative Lysholm knee scale and International Knee Documentation Committee subjective form scores. Results Data from 358 patients initially included in the study were analyzed; 22 were excluded because the time from injury to surgery was greater than 24 months, and 22 were lost to follow-up. From the cohort of 314 patients, 102 had more than 5° of knee hyperextension. A control group of the same size (n = 102) was selected by matching among the other 212 patients. Significant differences in the incidence of graft failure (14.7% vs 2.9%; P = .005) and Lysholm knee scale score (86.4 ± 9.8 vs 89.6 ± 6.1; P = .018) were found between the 2 groups. Conclusion Patients with more than 5° of contralateral knee hyperextension submitted to single-bundle ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendons have a higher failure rate than patients with less than 5° of knee hyperextension.

TI  - Knee Contact Force Asymmetries in Patients Who Failed Return-to-Sport Readiness Criteria 6 Months After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction:
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background:After anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, contact forces are decreased in the injured knee when compared with the uninjured knee. The persistence of contact force asymmetries after ACL reconstruction may increase the risk of reinjury and may play an important role in the development of knee osteoarthritis in these patients. Functional performance may also be useful in identifying patients who demonstrate potentially harmful joint contact force asymmetries after ACL reconstruction.Hypothesis:Knee joint contact force asymmetries would be present during gait after ACL reconstruction, and performance on a specific set of validated return-to-sport (RTS) readiness criteria would discriminate between those who demonstrated contact force asymmetries and those who did not.Study Design:Descriptive laboratory study.Methods:A total of 29 patients with ACL ruptures participated in gait analysis and RTS readiness testing 6 months after reconstruction. Muscle and joint contact forces were estimated using...

TI  - Arthroscopic posterior cruciate ligament repair.
PY  - 2002
AB  - Purpose: We present our technique of arthroscopic repair for femoral avulsion soft-tissue tears of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and its results. Type of Study: Case series, retrospective review. Methods: We performed 13 arthroscopic repairs of the PCL and reviewed them retrospectively. Follow-up was available for 11 (85%) patients. Nonabsorbable monofilament sutures were placed through the loose fibers of the ligament and tied over a bone bridge. Patients were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging, comparative stress views, and according to the scoring systems of Lysholm and Gillquist and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC). Results: Mean follow-up was 51.4 months. IKDC scores revealed 4 (36.4%) patients with normal knee function, and 7 (63.6%) with nearly normal function. Average Lysholm and Gillquist score was 95.4 (90 to 100). All athletes returned to the same or a higher level of competition. Conclusions: Arthroscopic repair of the PCL in patients with a femoral avulsion is effective in reducing postoperative instability and improving functional outcome. Key Words: Arthroscopy—Posterior cruciate ligament—Repair.

TI  - Inside-Out Repair of the Meniscus in Concomitant Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Absorbable Versus Nonabsorbable Sutures.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose To compare the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes of meniscal repair using absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures in patients undergoing concomitant anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods Data of 142 patients who underwent meniscal repair with concomitant anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using either absorbable or nonabsorbable sutures for longitudinal meniscal tear were retrospectively reviewed. Inside-out suture technique was used for all meniscal repairs. Weight bearing and flexion (>90°) were allowed after 6 weeks postoperatively. Clinical evaluations were assessed by the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity score preoperatively and at 2-year follow-up. MRI outcomes at 1-year follow-up were compared to identify the successful healing (complete or partial healing) rate and incidence of additional meniscal tears. Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate the results of medial or lateral meniscus. Results Eighty patients underwent meniscal repair using absorbable sutures (mean age, 26.3 ± 11.9 years) and 62 patients with nonabsorbable sutures (mean age, 27.2 ± 10.0 years). There were no differences in zone and length of meniscal tears and stability tests between the groups. At a 2-year follow-up, all clinical scores had improved in both groups but did not differ significantly between the groups. Successful healing rate based on 1-year postoperative MRI was not significantly different between the absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures (93.7% vs 96.8%, P = .469). However, the absorbable sutures showed a lower additional tear incidence than the nonabsorbable sutures (2.5% vs 9.6%, P = .031). Subgroup analysis showed that the successful healing rate was not significantly different between the suture materials in both the medial and lateral menisci. Conclusions The use of absorbable sutures leads to comparable healing rates to and lower incidence of additional tears than nonabsorbable sutures in patients undergoing meniscal repair with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative therapeutic trial.

TI  - Gait Mechanics and Tibiofemoral Loading in Men of the ACL-SPORTS Randomized Control Trial
PY  - 2018
AB  - The risk for post-traumatic osteoarthritis is elevated after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), and may be especially high among individuals with aberrant walking mechanics, such as medial tibiofemoral joint underloading 6 months postoperatively. Rehabilitation training programs have been proposed as one strategy to address aberrant gait mechanics. We developed the anterior cruciate ligament specialized post-operative return-to-sports (ACL-SPORTS) randomized control trial to test the effect of 10 post-operative training sessions consisting of strength, agility, plyometric, and secondary prevention exercises (SAPP) or SAPP plus perturbation (SAPP + PERT) training on gait mechanics after ACLR. A total of 40 male athletes (age 23 ± 7 years) after primary ACLR were randomized to SAPP or SAPP + PERT training and tested at three distinct, post-operative time points: 1) after impairment resolution (Pre-training); 2) following 10 training sessions (Post-training); and 3) 2 years after ACLR. Knee kinematic and kinetic variables as well as muscle and joint contact forces were calculated via inverse dynamics and a validated electromyography-informed musculoskeletal model. There were no significant improvements from Pre-training to Post-training in either intervention group. Smaller peak knee flexion angles, extension moments, extensor muscle forces, medial compartment contact forces, and tibiofemoral contact forces were present across group and time, however the magnitude of interlimb differences were generally smaller and likely not meaningful 2 years postoperatively. Neither SAPP nor SAPP + PERT training appears effective at altering gait mechanics in men in the short-term; however, meaningful gait asymmetries mostly resolved between post-training and 2 years after ACLR regardless of intervention group. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

TI  - Functional tests should be accentuated more in the decision for ACL reconstruction.
PY  - 2010
AB  - A high pre-injury activity level, the desire of the patient to continue pivoting sports and fear of future give-way episodes are considered the most significant factors affecting the decision to perform anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. However, since the functional status of the knee at the time of surgery affects the final outcome, assessments of knee function should be considered in the decision making for surgery. Individuals with anterior cruciate ligament injury can be classified as potential copers or non-copers from an existing screening examination. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the functional tests incorporated in the original screening examination could contribute to explain those who later go through anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and to examine whether changes to the content or the time of conducting the screening examination (before or after ten sessions of exercise therapy) could improve its explanatory value. One-hundred and forty-five individuals were included and prospectively followed for 15 months, after where 51% had gone through anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and 49% were managed non-operatively. The only significant baseline differences between those who later went through anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and those who were non-operatively treated were that those who had surgery were younger and had a higher activity level (P < 0.05). Regression analyses revealed that the explanatory value for those who later went through anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction significantly improved when the original screening examination was considered compared to only age, activity level and give-way episodes. Changes to the content further improved the explanatory value, with quadriceps muscle strength as the single variable with the highest impact. Finally, conducting the screening examination after ten sessions of progressive exercise therapy gave the overall highest explanatory values, suggesting that the screening examination should be conducted subsequent to a short period of rehabilitation to inform decision making for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

TI  - Osteoarthritic changes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone or hamstring tendon autografts: a retrospective, 7-year radiographic and clinical follow-up study.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Purpose: This study was undertaken to evaluate the long-term radiographic appearance and clinical outcome after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction by use of either bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) or hamstring tendon (HT) autografts and to evaluate how associated meniscal injuries affect the prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: ACL reconstruction was performed in 124 consecutive patients. Of these patients, 113 (91%) (72 BPTB and 41 HT) returned for a follow-up examination at a median of 86 months (range, 67 to 111 months) after reconstruction. The patients underwent standard weight-bearing radiographic examinations and clinical evaluation. Results: The radiographic assessments showed no significant differences between the graft types in terms of OA classified according to the Ahlback and Fairbank rating systems. Overall, 23% of the patients had degenerative changes according to the Ahlback system, and 74% had degenerative changes according to the Fairbank system. Associated meniscal injuries increased the prevalence of OA. Clinically, no significant differences were found between the graft types in terms of the Tegner activity test, 1-leg hop test, International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation system, disturbed area of sensitivity, manual Lachman test, KT-1000 laxity test (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and knee-walking test. The Lysholm score ( P = .02) and knee-walking ability ( P = .02) were significantly better in the HT group. Conclusions: At a median of 7 years after ACL reconstruction with either BPTB or HT autografts, the prevalence of OA as seen on standard weight-bearing radiographs and the clinical outcome were comparable. The presence of meniscal injuries increased the prevalence of OA. Level of Evidence: Level III, therapeutic, retrospective comparative study.

TI  - Effect of Posterolateral Bundle Graft Fixation Angles on Graft Tension Curves and Load Sharing in Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using a Transtibial Drilling Technique
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the effect of posterolateral bundle (PLB) graft fixation angles on graft tension curves and load sharing between the anteromedial bundle (AMB) and the PLB in double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods Twenty-four patients who underwent double-bundle ACL reconstruction were included in this study. AMB and PLB were provisionally fixed to a graft tensioning system during surgery. The graft fixation settings were as follows: (1) AMB at 20° and PLB at 0° (A20P0), (2) AMB at 20° and PLB at 20° (A20P20), and (3) AMB at 20° and PLB at 45° (A20P45). Bundle tension was recorded during knee flexion-extension and in response to anterior or rotatory loads. A pivot-shift test, as well as factors affecting the residual pivot-shift, was also evaluated. Results A20P45 created reciprocal tension curves and load sharing, in which the tension in both bundles was equivalent during flexion-extension and during each loading test at 30°. In A20P0, the tension of the AMB was constantly higher than that of the PLB. Seven patients showed grade 1 pivot-shift phenomenon in A20P0, whereas no patient showed a positive pivot-shift at other settings. Larger tension reduction of the PLB between 0° and 30° and smaller load sharing of the PLB were significant factors affecting residual pivot-shift. Conclusions In double-bundle ACL reconstruction, fixation of the AMB at 20° and the PLB at 45° created reciprocal tension curves and load sharing between the bundles. Fixation of the AMB at 20° and the PLB at 0° led to insufficient tension in the PLB, resulting in a residual pivot-shift phenomenon in 7 of 24 patients. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Quadriceps Tendon Autograft for Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review of Comparative Studies With Minimum 2-Year Follow-Up.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Purpose To systematically review the literature in an effort to compare outcomes of patients undergoing primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with a quadriceps tendon (QT) autograft versus a bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) or hamstring tendon (HT) autograft. Methods A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase to locate studies (Level of Evidence I-III) comparing the clinical outcomes of the QT autograft versus the BPTB or HT autograft in patients undergoing primary ACLR. Patients were evaluated based on graft failure rate, examination of knee laxity, and patient-reported outcome scores. Results Eight studies (1 Level II, 7 Level III) were identified that met inclusion criteria, including a total of 368 patients undergoing primary ACLR with a QT autograft, 225 with a BPTB autograft, and 150 with an HT autograft. The average follow-up duration for all patients was 2.9 years. Overall, 2.8% of patients (17/603) experienced graft failure. Within the studies that compared the QT versus BPTB autograft, no study found a significant difference in graft failure rate between groups, and the odds ratio for graft failure between QT and BPTB was found to be 1.58 (95% confidence interval: 0.49-5.07; P  = .44). Within the studies that compared graft failure rate between the QT and HT autograft, none found significant differences between groups, although a meta-analysis was not performed because of a low number of trials. Two studies found significantly greater postoperative knee laxity in HT patients compared with QT patients ( P Conclusions Patients undergoing primary ACLR with either a QT, BPTB, or HT autograft can all be expected to experience improvement in clinical outcomes. QT patients experienced less knee laxity postoperatively compared with HT patients, although no significant differences were found in graft failure rate between groups. Level of Evidence Level III, systematic review of Level II and III studies.

TI  - Efficacy of β-Tricalcium Phosphate Graft into the Bone Defects after Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2016
AB  - This prospective pilot study investigated whether grafting β-tricalcium phosphate (B-TCP) into the bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB)-harvesting site after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction would accelerate bone and tendon regeneration in the grafted site. Overall, 19 patients agreed prospectively to undergo regular morphological and histological examinations of the B-TCP-grafted site. Postoperative radiographic, ultrasonographic, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were performed to evaluate the grafted site at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Postoperative knee function and donor-site morbidity were assessed at 12 months using the kneeling test. A histological examination was also performed at this time Radiographic examination and MRI showed that the grafted B-TCP was completely absorbed and remodeled into normal bone structure in the tibia and patella at 6 months postoperatively. Histological and ultrasonographic examinations of all subjects showed that the grafted B-TCP was substituted by normal bone tissue, and the patellar tendon − bone junction had regenerated at 12 months postoperatively. Clinical functional knee tests showed good recovery of the donor site. All patients could perform kneeling and knee walking on hard ground. The results of this pilot study suggest that grafting B-TCP into the BPTB-harvesting site promotes the remodeling process of the bone and patellar tendon structures. This surgical treatment would decrease an incidence of the anterior knee pain after ACLR using a BPTB autograft.

          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A prospective cohort of patients with acute ACL injury was divided into 2 groups based on the presence (ALL injury group) or absence (control group) of ALL injury on preoperative MRI. This is a longer-term follow-up study of a previously published study that had a minimum 2-year follow-up. Both groups underwent anatomic isolated reconstruction of the ACL. The Lysholm and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee scores, KT-1000 arthrometer and pivot-shift tests, reconstruction failure rate, incidence of contralateral ACL injury, presence of associated meniscal injury, and presence of knee hyperextension were evaluated. The evaluation at the 5-year follow-up was also compared with the same patient's evaluation at 2 years of follow-up.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 156 patients were evaluated. No significant differences were found between the groups in the preoperative evaluation. In the postoperative evaluation, patients in the ALL injury group had a higher reconstruction failure rate (14.3% vs 4.6% for the control group; <i>P</i> = .049) and worse clinical outcomes according to the Lysholm scores (85.0 ± 10.3 vs 92.3 ± 6.6; <i>P</i> &lt; .00001). Although the pivot-shift test results were similar, anteroposterior translation using the KT-1000 arthrometer revealed worse results for the ALL injury group (2.8 ± 1.4 mm vs 1.9 ± 1.3 mm; <i>P</i> = .00018). Patients in the ALL injury group also had an increase in KT-1000 arthrometer values from 2 to 5 years (2.4 ± 1.6 vs 2.8 ± 1.4; <i>P</i> = .038). Patients in the control group had no differences in outcomes from 2 to 5 years of follow-up.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Combined ACL and ALL injuries were associated with significantly less favorable outcomes than were isolated ACL injuries at a minimum follow-up of 5 years after isolated ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft. Patients with concomitant ALL injury showed a higher failure rate and worse functional scores. Also, knee stability tended to slightly worsen from 2 to 5 years in cases of associated ALL injury.</AbstractText>

TI  - Bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft versus allograft in outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a meta-analysis of 5182 patients.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background:Bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) is a common autograft and allograft source used for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Although the failure rate is generally higher for allografts, donor site morbidity and anterior knee pain can be issues with BPTB autografts. Controversy exists regarding the functional outcomes, complications, and knee stability of these grafts, previous comparisons of which have been based on smaller samples of case series.Purpose:To compare BPTB autografts to allografts for ACL reconstruction, specifically with regard to patient satisfaction, return to preinjury activity level, and postoperative functional outcomes.Study Design:Meta-analysis.Methods:A total of 76 studies published between 1998 and 2012, including a total of 5182 patients, were reviewed. It was not required for studies to be comparative in nature. Outcomes evaluated were graft rupture rate, return to preinjury activity level, overall and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IK...

TI  - Return to pivoting sport after ACL reconstruction: association with osteoarthritis and knee function at the 15-year follow-up
PY  - 2018
AB  - Objectives To examine the associations between return to pivoting sport following ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and knee osteoarthritis (OA), and self-reported knee symptoms, function and quality of life after 15 years. Methods Study sample included 258 participants with ACLR 15 years previously. Return to pivoting sport (handball, soccer and basketball) data were collected by interviews, and symptomatic OA was defined as Kellgren and Lawrence grade ≥2 plus almost daily knee pain in the last month. Self-reported symptoms, function and quality of life were assessed with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Adjusted regression models were used to analyse the associations between return to pivoting sport and OA (present or not), and self-reported outcomes. P values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Two hundred and ten (81%) participants (57% men) with a mean age of 39.1 (±8.7) years completed the 15-year follow-up, and 109 (52%) had returned to pivoting sport. Returning to pivoting sport was associated with less symptomatic OA (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.89) and radiographic OA (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.98), adjusted for age, sex, combined injury, self-reported knee function, and time between injury and surgery. Those who returned to pivoting sport had better function in activities of daily living (ADL). Conclusion The participants with ACLR who returned to pivoting sport had lower odds of knee OA and better self-reported ADL function. Further investigation is required to understand the clinical significance of these findings.

TI  - Effect of Posterolateral Bundle Graft Fixation Angles on Clinical Outcomes in Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction A Randomized Controlled Trial
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background:In double-bundle (DB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, no consensus exists on an optimal setting for the posterolateral bundle (PLB) graft fixation angles.Hypothesis:Different PLB fixation angles would affect clinical outcomes in DB ACL reconstruction.Study Design:Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.Methods:This study prospectively included 90 patients who underwent primary DB ACL reconstruction with an autologous semitendinosus tendon. The PLB fixation angles were randomly set as follows: 0° of flexion (P0; n = 30), 20° (P20; n = 30), and 45° (P45; n = 30). In all groups, the anteromedial bundle was fixed at 20° of flexion. The following evaluation methods were used at the preoperative period and at 3, 6, and 9 months and 1 and 2 years after the surgery: clinical examination, KT-1000 arthrometer measurement, muscle strength, Tegner score, Lysholm score, and subjective rating scale regarding patient satisfaction and sports performance levels.

TI  - Quality of Life Assessment in Elite Collegiate Athletes
PY  - 2001
AB  - The objectives of this study were to establish baseline Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) data for Division I collegiate athletes and to determine the effects of injury severity and training time. All participating athletes (N = 562) at a major university were evaluated with the SF-36. Regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors. When the men without injury were compared with a previously established norm group, there was a significant increase in the role emotional score. In the women without injury there were significant increases in mental component summary, physical function, role emotional, mental health, and vitality scores when compared with the norm group. Serious injury was a predictor of lower scores in all domains, whereas minimal injury was predictive of lower physical component summary, role physical, bodily pain, social function, and general health scores. Increased training time was predictive of higher mental component summary, role physical, vitality, and general health scores. Elite collegiate athletes scored differently from previously established age-matched norms, and injury was a strong predictor of lower scores.

TI  - Patellofemoral osteoarthritis is prevalent and associated with worse symptoms and function after hamstring tendon autograft ACL reconstruction
PY  - 2013
AB  - Objectives To evaluate the compartmental distribution of knee osteoarthritis (OA) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), to determine if patellofemoral or tibiofemoral OA is more strongly associated with knee symptoms and function, and to evaluate the contribution of associated injuries and surgical delay to the development of OA. Methods This cross-sectional study recruited 70 participants who underwent hamstring tendon (HT) ACLR 5–10 years previously. Radiographic OA was assessed according to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) criteria. Knee symptoms were assessed with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS), while function was assessed with three lower limb tasks (hop-for-distance, one-leg rise and side-hop). Multivariate and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between OA and symptomatic/functional outcomes and associated injuries/surgical delay, respectively. Results Radiographic OA was observed in the patellofemoral (47%) and tibiofemoral joints (31%). Pain, symptoms and quality of life on the KOOS and the AKPS were associated with severity of patellofemoral OA (standardised regression coefficient (β)=−0.3 to −0.5, p=0.001–0.042), whereas only the KOOS-pain subscale was associated with tibiofemoral OA (β=−0.3, p=0.037). For each functional task, greater patellofemoral OA severity was associated with worse performance, independent of tibiofemoral OA severity (β=−0.3 to −0.4, p=0.001–0.026). Medial meniscal and patellofemoral chondral lesions at surgery were associated with tibiofemoral and patellofemoral OA development at follow-up, respectively, while a longer surgery delay was associated with patellofemoral OA. Conclusions Patellofemoral OA is common following HT ACLR and is associated with worse knee-related symptoms, including anterior knee pain, and decreased functional performance.

TI  - A comparison of results in middle-aged and young patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2000
AB  - The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the results after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in middle-aged and young patients. From our database (including 604 patients with a follow-up rate of 95%), we extracted all the patients over 40 years of age (group A, n = 30) and compared them with a group of patients from the same material, aged between 20 and 24 years (group B, n = 37). The groups were comparable in terms of the male:female ratio and surgical techniques. The follow-up was performed by independent observers. The median follow-up period was 31 months (range, 22 to 60 months) in group A and 38 months (24 to 60 months) in group B (P =.014). Before injury, the Tegner activity level was 6 (4-9) in group A and 9 (4-9) in group B (P <.001). At follow-up, the Tegner activity level was 5 (3-9) in group A and 6 (3-9) in group B (P =.032). At the follow-up, there was no difference in terms of the Lysholm score, which was 91 (37-100) and 89 (38-100) points in group A and group B, respectively. Using the IKDC evaluation system, 10 patients (33%) were classified as normal, 12 (40%) as nearly normal, 6 (20%) as abnormal, and 2 (7%) as severely abnormal in group A, compared with 8 (22%) normal, 18 (48%) nearly normal, 10 (27%) abnormal, and 1 (3%) severely abnormal in group B (NS). The 1-leg hop quotient was 90% (52-167) in group A and 93% (70-118) in group B (P =.056). The KT-1000 measurement showed an anterior side-to-side laxity difference of 2.0 mm (-4 to 8.5 mm) in group A and 2.0 mm (-2.5 to 8.0 mm) in group B (not significant). The middle-aged patients were subjectively more pleased with the results than the younger patients. There were no differences in either early or late complications between the groups. At the index operation, 11 of 30 patients (37%) in group A and 1 of 37 (3%) in group B had cartilage lesions or degenerative changes (P <.001). Age does not appear to disqualify middle-aged patients with symptomatic ACL tears from undergoing reconstruction.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With LARS Artificial Ligament: A Multicenter Study With 3- to 5-Year Follow-up
PY  - 2010
AB  - Purpose The aim of this multicenter study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction by use of the Ligament Advanced Reinforcement System (LARS) artificial ligament (Surgical Implants and Devices, Arc-sur-Tille, France) with 3- to 5-year follow-up. Methods From August 2004 to July 2006, 159 patients with ACL rupture underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with LARS artificial ligament at 4 orthopaedic sports medicine centers in China. They were retrospectively followed up for 50 ± 6 months (range, 36 to 62 months). Outcome assessment included physical examination, KT-1000 arthrometer testing (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), magnetic resonance imaging, radiography, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, and subjective satisfaction rate. Quadriceps and hamstring isokinetic strength was evaluated in 68 patients. Results The side-to-side difference in anterior translation (injured side − uninjured side) measured by KT-1000 arthrometer was 1.5 ± 1.6 mm (range, −1 to 7 mm) postoperatively, and knee stability was significantly improved compared with preoperative data ( P P P Conclusions ACL reconstruction with LARS artificial ligament used in patients with the ACL stump preserved in the acute and chronic phases has a very good outcome at mean of 50 months' follow-up. The overall complication rate for ACL reconstruction with LARS artificial ligament is 5.7%, and knee synovitis developed in only 1 case. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - The Docking Technique for Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction: Surgical Technique and Clinical Outcome
PY  - 2009
AB  - BackgroundCurrent techniques of medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction vary with respect to methods of fixation on the femur and the patella. This article presents the outcomes of a surgical technique for reconstruction of the MPFL that uses a soft tissue graft with interference screw fixation on the femur and a docking technique for fixation on the patella.HypothesisPatients with patellar instability who are treated with the docking technique for MPFL reconstruction will have improvements in knee symptoms and function, with a high percentage achieving good to excellent results at early follow-up.Study DesignCase series; Level of evidence, 4.MethodsTwenty consecutive patients with patellar instability underwent reconstruction of the MPFL. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively by physical and radiographic examination and subjectively with the IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee), Tegner, Kujala, and Lysholm questionnaires.

TI  - Intratunnel versus extratunnel fixation of hamstring autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Purpose To determine which is more effective: intratunnel or extratunnel anterior cruciate ligament soft-tissue graft fixation. A secondary purpose was to determine whether groups displayed differing relations between objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) grade and the timing of full weight bearing (FWB), jogging/running, and return to sports. The study hypotheses were that intratunnel fixation would display a greater percentage of normal or nearly normal objective IKDC grades and enable earlier FWB, return to jogging/running, and return to sports. Methods We performed a systematic review of prospective, Studies with Level I or II evidence published from 2000 to 2011 with at least 2 years' follow-up that used interference screw hamstring autograft fixation (intratunnel group) or button, staple, or post hamstring autograft fixation (extratunnel group) for primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. We also compared IKDC grades; Tegner and Lysholm scores; instrumented anterior laxity and pivot-shift test findings; timing of FWB, jogging/running, and return to sports; and modified Coleman Methodology Scores. Results The groups showed comparable modified Coleman Methodology Scores, objective IKDC grades, Lysholm and Tegner scores, instrumented anterior laxity and pivot-shift test findings, and return-to-sports timing. The intratunnel group displayed earlier FWB and jogging/running; however, return-to-sports timing did not differ between groups. Early FWB and the percentage of patients with normal or nearly normal objective IKDC grades were directly related for the extratunnel group. Conclusions Patients who received intratunnel fixation were released earlier to FWB and jogging/running, supporting the study hypotheses. Groups did not differ in return-to-sports timing or objective IKDC grades, not supporting the study hypotheses. Early FWB in the extratunnel group was related to a greater percentage of patients having normal or nearly normal objective IKDC grades. Return-to-sports timing and having a normal objective IKDC grade were related in both groups; however, this relation was stronger with intratunnel fixation. Level of Evidence Level II, systematic review of Level I and II studies.

TI  - The measurement of medial knee gap width using ultrasound.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Medial knee instability is a key clinical parameter for assessing ligament injury and arthroplasty success, but current methods for measuring stability are typically either qualitative or involve ionizing radiation. The purpose of this study was to perform a preliminary analysis of whether ultrasound (US) could be used as an alternate approach for quantifying medial instability by comparing an US method with an approach mimicking the current gold standard fluoroscopy method. US data from the medial knee were collected, while cadaveric lower limbs (n = 8) were loaded in valgus (10 Nm). During post-processing, the US gap width was measured by identifying the medial edges of the femur and tibia and computing the gap width between these points. For comparison, mimicked fluoroscopy (mFluoro) images were created from specimen-specific bone models, developed from segmented CT scans, and from kinematic data collected during testing. Then, gap width was measured in the mFluoro images based on two different published approaches with gap width measured either at the most medial or at the most distal aspect of the femur. Gap width increased significantly with loading (p < 0.001), and there were no significant differences between the US method (unloaded: 8.7 ± 2.4 mm, loaded: 10.7 ± 2.2 mm) and the mFluoro method that measured gap width at the medial femur. In terms of the change in gap width with load, no correlation with the change in abduction angle was observed, with no correlation between the various methods. Inter-rater reliability for the US method was high (0.899–0.952). Ultrasound shows promise as a suitable alternative for quantifying medial instability without radiation exposure. However, the outstanding limitations of existing approaches and lack of true ground-truth data require that further validation work is necessary to better understand the clinical viability of an US approach for measuring medial knee gap width.

TI  - Physiologic Preoperative Knee Hyperextension Is Not Associated With Postoperative Laxity, Subjective Knee Function, or Revision Surgery After ACL Reconstruction With Hamstring Tendon Autografts.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">There is concern that physiologic knee hyperextension may be associated with inferior outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using hamstring tendon (HT) autografts.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To assess whether there is an association between contralateral passive preoperative knee hyperextension (≤-5°) and postoperative anterior knee laxity, subjective knee function, or revision surgery after ACLR using HT autografts.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Patients without concomitant ligament injuries who underwent primary ACLR using an HT autograft at Capio Artro Clinic, Stockholm, Sweden, between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2018, were identified. The cohort was dichotomized into the hyperextension group (≤-5°) and the no hyperextension group (&gt;-5°) depending on preoperative contralateral passive knee extension degree. Anterior knee laxity (KT-1000 arthrometer; 134 N) was assessed preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was collected preoperatively and at 1, 2, and 5 years postoperatively. Patients who underwent revision ACLR at any institution in Sweden within 5 years of the primary surgery were identified in the Swedish National Knee Ligament Registry.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 6104 patients (53.5% male) for whom knee range of motion measurements were available were identified (hyperextension group [≤-5°]: 2350 [38.5%]; mean extension, -6.1°± 2.3° [range, -20° to -5°]; no hyperextension group [&gt;-5°]: 3754 [61.5%]; mean extension, 0°± 1.4° [range, -4° to 15°]). There were no intergroup differences in anterior knee laxity preoperatively (hyperextension group, 3.6 ± 2.8 mm; no hyperextension group, 3.7 ± 2.7 mm; <i>P</i> = .24) or postoperatively (hyperextension group, 1.8 ± 2.3 mm; no hyperextension group, 1.8 ± 2.2 mm; <i>P</i> = .41). The only significant but nonclinically relevant intergroup differences were seen in the KOOS Symptoms subscale at the 1-year follow-up (hyperextension group, 81.4 ± 16.0; no hyperextension group, 80.3 ± 16.5; <i>P</i> = .03) and in the Sport and Recreation subscale at the 5-year follow-up (hyperextension group, 73.0 ± 25.6; no hyperextension group, 75.7 ± 24.3; <i>P</i> = .02). No other significant intergroup differences were noted preoperatively or at 1, 2, or 5 years postoperatively in any of the KOOS subscales. The overall revision ACLR rate at ≤5 years after the primary surgery was 4.9% (302 of 6104 patients). The hazard for revision ACLR in the no hyperextension group (4.5%; 170 of 3754 patients) was not significantly different from that in the hyperextension group (5.6%; 132 of 2350 patients) (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.71 to -1.12; <i>P</i> = .34). A subsequent subanalysis showed that the hazard of revision ACLR in patients with no hyperextension was not significantly different from that of patients with ≤-10° of extension (5.8%; 27 of 467 patients) (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.36; <i>P</i> = .65).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Preoperative passive contralateral knee hyperextension (≤-5°) was not associated with postoperative anterior knee laxity, subjective knee function, or revision surgery ≤5 years after ACLR using HT autografts. Therefore, the presence of knee hyperextension alone should not be considered a contraindication per se for the use of HT autografts in ACLR.</AbstractText>

TI  - Validation and Implementation of 4-domain Patient-reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) Tailored for Orthopedic Sports Medicine.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The validation of a 4-domain PROM tailored to orthopedic sports medicine was performed through item generation, item scaling, validity and reliability testing, statistical analysis, as well as item reduction. Conbrach's alpha was used to verify item homogeneity, i. e. their accuracy or consistency. This PROM showed acceptable statistical accuracy and clinical applicability for a variety of surgical treatments, regardless of the anatomical injury sites. Moreover, this PROM considers the athletes’ primary physical demands in an non-injured baseline condition, their motivation to continue sports practice and participation, and the influence of sports practice on their quality of life. This 4-domain PROM tailored for orthopedic sports medicine appears to be a valid tool to assess athletes and high-performing practitioners with sports injuries, recording their perception of injury, expectations of treatment; evaluation of postoperative care and treatment received, and perceived outcomes compared to their pre-injury status of physical demands in sports activity. The tool is unique, allowing direct comparisons between athletes’ perception of pre-injury baseline, injury, treatment, and outcome. It will be a welcome adjunct to the sports medicine professional’s tool box when assessing athlete’s status and outcome after injury and intervention.

TI  - Surgical technique for treatment of concomitant grade II MCL lesion in patients with ACL rupture.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Combined lesions of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) are frequent in athletes. While surgical treatment of ACL injury is mandatory treatment regime of concomitant grade II MCL lesions remains unclear with tendency to surgical intervention. Standardized surgical technique is lacking. Present study wants to introduce surgical technique for treatment of concomitant grade II MCL lesion and report short term outcome results. 5 Patients with acute ACL rupture and grade II MCL-lesion were included. All patients received surgical treatment of concomitant MCL lesion by distinct surgical technique and ACL reconstruction. We evaluated valgus instability, anterior instability and range of motion (ROM) according to international knee documentation commitee (IKDC) and Lysholm‑Score both preoperative and after 6, 16 weeks and 9 months postoperative. All Patients showed excellent clinical results at final follow-up. Valgus and anterior stability could be restored in all patients. 1 patient (20%) lost 15° in flexion of ROM at final follow up. However in all 5 patients (100%) the findings were graded as normal or nearly nor-mal according to IKDC knee examination form. Lysholm-Score averaged 94,6. Therefore presented surgical technique improved both, valgus and anterior stability, and led to excellent short term results at final follow up.

TI  - Rehabilitation after ACL injury and reconstruction from the patients' perspective.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe and compare patients’ appraisal of the rehabilitation and adherence to the rehabilitation program after acute ACL injury treated with (ACLR) or without (non-ACLR) reconstruction. Design Prospective cohort study. Participants 275 patients (143 females; mean age 25 ± 7 years) with acute ACL injury, of whom 166 patients had ACLR within 24 months. Main outcome Adherence to rehabilitation was assessed using the modified Sports Injury Rehabilitation Adherence Scale (SIRAS). Results Appraisal of rehabilitation was higher in the post-ACLR group compared to the non-ACLR group at 3 months (91% compared to 70% scored rehabilitation as necessary, p = 0.025) and at 6 months (87% compared to 70% scored it as necessary, p = 0.017). SIRAS score did not differ between 3 and 6 months for the non-ACLR group (median (IQR) 13 (2) vs 13 (2)) or the post-ACLR group (14 (1) vs 14 (2), p > 0.05). The post-ACLR group had a higher SIRAS score than the non-ACLR group at 3 and 6 months (p ≤ 0.001). Conclusion Patients treated with ACLR reported valuing their rehabilitation more and rated greater adherence to the rehabilitation programme than non-surgically treated patients. As rehabilitation is essential for good knee function, strategies to improve adherence after non-ACLR treatment should be implemented. Level of evidence Prospective cohort study, level II.

TI  - Sex and Mechanism of Injury Influence Knee Joint Loading Symmetry During Gait 6 months after ACLR
PY  - 2020
AB  - Early-onset knee osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with gait asymmetries after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Women have higher risks of sustaining non-contact injuries, and are more likely to present with aberrant movement patterns associated with the mechanism of injury (MOI). We hypothesized that sex and MOI would influence gait after ACLR. Seventy participants, grouped by sex and MOI, completed biomechanical testing during over-ground walking when they had full knee range of motion, trace or less knee effusion, greater than 80% quadriceps strength limb symmetry index, ability to hop on each leg without pain, and initiated running. Bilateral knee kinetics, kinematics, and joint contact forces were compared using mixed-model analysis of variance (α = .05). There was a three-way interaction effect of sex × MOI × limb for peak medial compartment contact force (P = .002), our primary outcome measure previously associated with OA development. Men with non-contact injuries walked with asymmetry characterized by underloading of the involved limb. Men with contact injuries walked with the most symmetrical loading. In women, no clear pattern emerged based on MOI. Targeting, and possibly prioritizing interventions for athletes who present with gait asymmetries after ACLR based on sex and MOI, may be necessary to optimize outcomes. Statement of Clinical Significance: Sex and MOI may influence walking mechanics, and could be considered in future interventions to target gait symmetry, as a response to interventions may vary based on differences in sex and MOI.

TI  - Arthroscopic suture fixation for avulsion fractures in the tibial attachment of the posterior cruciate ligament.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Purpose The purpose of the study was to highlight our surgical technique of arthroscopic suture fixation for acute tibial eminence posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) avulsion fractures, clinical and radiographic outcomes, and complication rates. Methods This prospective study enrolled patients who had undergone arthroscopic reduction and suture fixation by use of 4 No. 5 Ethibond sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) for image-proven displaced PCL attachment fractures of the tibial eminence with posterior knee instability of grade II or higher. The mean follow-up period was 36 months (range, 24 to 45 months). Follow-up assessment included 3 different functional scores, KT-1000 arthrometry (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and radiographic evaluation. Results The mean preoperative Lysholm score in the 36 patients was 35 (range, 26 to 55); the mean postoperative Lysholm score was 95 (range, 80 to 100). The mean preinjury and preoperative Tegner scores in the 36 patients were 7.4 ± 1.6 (range, 5 to 9) and 3.2 ± 1.5 (range, 2 to 5), respectively. The mean postoperative Tegner score was 7.0 ± 1.8 (range, 5 to 9). At the final follow-up, the International Knee Documentation Committee scores were observed to be normal (grade A) or nearly normal (grade B) in 33 patients (91.7%) and abnormal (grade C) in 3 patients (8.3%). All 36 fractures achieved union within 3 months. No significant complications such as arthrofibrosis, loss of initial fixation, or wound infection were noted. Conclusions Treatment of tibial PCL avulsion fractures by arthroscopic suture fixation is a successful technique to restore tibial avulsion injuries of the PCL with well-documented radiographic healing, good clinical outcomes, and low complication rates. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Repair versus reconstruction for proximal anterior cruciate ligament tears: a study protocol for a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial
PY  - 2021
AB  - For active patients with a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) who would like to return to active level of sports, the current surgical gold standard is reconstruction of the ACL. Recently, there has been renewed interest in repairing the ACL in selected patients with a proximally torn ligament. Repair of the ligament has (potential) advantages over reconstruction of the ligament such as decreased surgical morbidity, faster return of range of motion, and potentially decreased awareness of the knee. Studies comparing both treatments in a prospective randomized method are currently lacking. This study is a multicenter prospective block randomized controlled trial. A total of 74 patients with acute proximal isolated ACL tears will be assigned in a 1:1 allocation ratio to either (I) ACL repair using cortical button fixation and additional suture augmentation or (II) ACL reconstruction using an all-inside autologous hamstring graft technique. The primary objective is to assess if ACL repair is non-inferior to ACL reconstruction regarding the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at two-years postoperatively. The secondary objectives are to assess if ACL repair is non-inferior with regards to (I) other patient-reported outcomes measures (i.e. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Lysholm score, Forgotten Joint Score, patient satisfaction and pain), (II) objective outcome measures (i.e. failure of repair or graft defined as rerupture or symptomatic instability, reoperation, contralateral injury, and stability using the objective IKDC score and Rollimeter/KT-2000), (III) return to sports assessed by Tegner activity score and the ACL-Return to Sports Index at two-year follow-up, and (IV) long-term osteoarthritis at 10-year follow-up. Over the last decade there has been a resurgence of interest in repair of proximally torn ACLs. Several cohort studies have shown encouraging short-term and mid-term results using these techniques, but prospective randomized studies are lacking. Therefore, this randomized controlled trial has been designed to assess whether ACL repair is at least equivalent to the current gold standard of ACL reconstruction in both subjective and objective outcome scores.

TI  - Healing of the Acutely Injured Anterior Cruciate Ligament: Functional Treatment with the ACL-Jack, a Dynamic Posterior Drawer Brace
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background. The injured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has a limited healing capacity leading to persisting instability. Hypothesis/Purpose. To study if the application of a brace, producing a dynamic posterior drawer force, after acute ACL injury reduces initial instability. Study Design. Cohort study. Methods. Patients treated with the ACL-Jack brace were compared to controls treated with primary ACL reconstruction und controls treated nonsurgically with functional rehabilitation. Measurements included anterior laxity (Rolimeter), clinical scores (Lysholm, Tegner, and IKDC), and MRI evaluation. Patients were followed up to 24 months. Results. Patients treated with the ACL-Jack brace showed a significant improvement of anterior knee laxity comparable to patients treated with ACL reconstruction, whereas laxity persisted after nonsurgical functional rehabilitation. The failure risk (secondary reconstruction necessary) of the ACL-Jack group was however 21% (18 of 86) within 24 months. Clinical scores were similar in all treatment groups. Conclusion. Treatment of acute ACL tears with the ACL-Jack brace leads to improved anterior knee laxity compared to nonsurgical treatment with functional rehabilitation.

TI  - Assessing the progress of rehabilitation in patients with ACL reconstruction using the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form
PY  - 2011
AB  - There are numerous assessment tools designed to provide information on the results of reconstructive surgery of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). They are also used for monitoring progress and facilitating clinical decision-making during the rehabilitation process. A brief summary of some existing tools specifically designed to evaluate knee ligament injuries is presented in this article. Then, one of those outcome measures, the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC) was applied to a group of patients (N = 10) who had undergone surgery for ACL reconstruction. The patients attended the same physiotherapy service and followed a unified rehabilitation protocol. The assessment was performed twice: four and six months after surgery. The results showed an improvement in the rehabilitation of most patients tested (verified by a difference equal to or greater than 9 points on the IKDC outcome between measurements 1 and 2). The IKDC probed to be an instrument of quick and easy application. It provided quantitative data about the progress of rehabilitation and could be applied in everyday clinical physiotherapy practice. However, the results suggested considering the IKDC as one component of an evaluation kit to make decisions regarding the progress of the rehabilitation treatment.

TI  - Simple decision rules can reduce reinjury risk by 84% after ACL reconstruction: the Delaware-Oslo ACL cohort study
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background Knee reinjury after ACL reconstruction is common and increases the risk of osteoarthritis. There is sparse evidence to guide return to sport (RTS) decisions in this population.

Objectives To assess the relationship between knee reinjury after ACL reconstruction and (1) return to level I sports, (2) timing of RTS and (3) knee function prior to return.

Methods 106 patients who participated in pivoting sports participated in this prospective 2-year cohort study. Sports participation and knee reinjury were recorded monthly. Knee function was assessed with the Knee Outcome Survey—Activities of Daily Living Scale, global rating scale of function, and quadriceps strength and hop test symmetry. Pass RTS criteria were defined as scores >90 on all tests, failure as failing any.

Results Patients who returned to level I sports had a 4.32 (p=0.048) times higher reinjury rate than those who did not. The reinjury rate was significantly reduced by 51% for each month RTS was delayed until 9 months after surgery, after which no further risk reduction was observed. 38.2% of those who failed RTS criteria suffered reinjuries versus 5.6% of those who passed (HR 0.16, p=0.075). More symmetrical quadriceps strength prior to return significantly reduced the knee reinjury rate.

Conclusions Returning to level I sports after ACL reconstruction leads to a more than 4-fold increase in reinjury rates over 2 years. RTS 9 months or later after surgery and more symmetrical quadriceps strength prior to return substantially reduce the reinjury rate.

TI  - AMIC-Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis Technique in Patellar Cartilage Defects Treatment: A Retrospective Study with a Mid-Term Follow-Up.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background: Knee cartilage defects can be retrieved in 60% of patients undergoing knee arthroscopy, especially in the patellofemoral joint. Different techniques have been proposed to treat patellar defects, although most of them are associated with short-term results. In this study Autologous Matrix Induced Chondrogenesis (AMIC), combining subchondral microfractures with a collagen membrane (type I and III collagen), was used in the treatment of isolated patellar cartilage defects. Methods: Twenty-four patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Subjective-International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS), and Kujala score were collected at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, whereas the Tegner Activity Level Scale was determined preoperatively and at final follow-up (final-FU). The same postoperative management and rehabilitation protocol was adopted for all the patients. Results: Fourteen patients met the inclusion–exclusion criteria and were evaluated at a mean final-FU of 68.2 months (range 25.4–111.2). At 12 months, Kujala, IKDC, and VAS scores significantly increased in comparison to the preoperative assessment, whereas no statistically significant differences were reported between 12 months and final follow-up. Conclusion: This study demonstrated very good results throughout the follow-up, also in sports patients. The AMIC technique, together with an adequate rehabilitation protocol, can be considered as a reliable one-step alternative for the treatment of large isolated patellar cartilage defects.

TI  - Outcomes after meniscal repair using the meniscus arrow in knees undergoing concurrent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract Purpose: To determine the healing rate of meniscal repair using the Meniscus Arrow (Bionx, Blue Bell, PA) in patients undergoing concurrent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and to evaluate patient outcomes with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form and a visual analog scale (VAS). Type of Study: Case series with outcomes analysis. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 38 consecutive patients with 39 meniscal tears in knees undergoing concurrent endoscopic ACL reconstruction whose menisci were repaired with the Meniscus Arrow system. All meniscal tears were deemed amenable to repair according to length, stability, morphology, and zone of tear. There were 31 medial and 8 lateral meniscal tears, with an average tear length of 2.1 cm. An average of 2.5 arrows were used to repair each tear. All 39 tears were located in the posterior horn of the meniscus or extending into the body of the meniscus from the posterior horn. Follow-up was assessed by clinical examination, the knee disorders subjective history, VAS, and the IKDC evaluation form. Reconstructed ACL laxity was assessed by KT-2000 arthrometry and clinical evaluation. Results: At an average follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 18-39 months), 32 patients have been surveyed to date. The success rate was 90.6% (29 of 32 patients) with 3 patients going on to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. KT-2000 arthrometry showed that sagittal knee laxity was less than 3 mm in all reconstructed knees. Clinical criteria for success in the rest of the repaired menisci included (1) the absence of locking, catching, or giving way; (2) no history of recurrent effusions; (3) no joint line tenderness; (4) a negative McMurray test; and (5) no subsequent surgical procedures on the repaired meniscus. Additionally, the VAS showed the ability of these patients to return to a high level of activity, including competitive sports, without symptoms suggestive of a meniscal tear. The IKDC showed normal or nearly normal function of all success knees. Conclusions: The study shows that a high rate of meniscus healing can be achieved by the all-inside, bioabsorbable Meniscus Arrow system in conjunction with ACL reconstruction. Also, patients have excellent function of their knee and are able to return to a high level of activity. Our healing rates are comparable to those previously reported with the inside-out suture techniques without the need for an additional posterior incision that would increase operative time and risk to neurovascular structures.

TI  - Patellar instability.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Recurrent patellar instability can result from osseous abnormalities, such as patella alta, a distance of >20 mm between the tibial tubercle and the trochlear groove, and trochlear dysplasia, or it can result from soft-tissue abnormalities, such as a torn medial patellofemoral ligament or a weakened vastus medialis obliquus. Nonoperative treatment includes physical therapy, focusing on strengthening of the gluteal muscles and the vastus medialis obliquus, and patellar taping or bracing. Acute medial-sided repair may be indicated when there is an osteochondral fracture fragment or a retinacular injury. The recent literature does not support the use of an isolated lateral release for the treatment of patellar instability. A patient with recurrent instability, with or without trochlear dysplasia, who has a normal tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance and a normal patellar height may be a candidate for a reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament with autograft or allograft. Distal realignment procedures are used in patients who have an increased tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance or patella alta. The degree of anteriorization, distalization, and/or medialization depends on associated arthrosis of the lateral patellar facet and the presence of patella alta. Associated medial or proximal patellar chondrosis is a contraindication to distal realignment because of the potential to overload tissues that have already undergone degeneration.

TI  - Treatment of cartilage defects of the talus by autologous osteochondral grafts
PY  - 2002
AB  - We reviewed retrospectively 11 patients who had been treated surgically by open autologous osteochondral grafting for symptomatic chondral or osteochondral defects of the dome of the talus between 1996 and 1999. The mean ages of the eight men and three women were 34.2 and 25.9 years, respectively, with a mean time to follow-up of 24 months. The results of functional outcome were prospectively obtained using the MODEMS AAOS foot and ankle follow-up questionnaire, the AOFAS ankle-hindfoot scale and the Hannover scores for the ankle. The grafts were harvested from the ipsilateral knee. Good to excellent results were obtained for the ankle without adverse effects on the knee. We believe that autologous osteochondral grafting should be considered for the patient with a symptomatic osteochondral defect of the talus.

TI  - Antero-medial portal vs. transtibial techniques for drilling femoral tunnel in ACL reconstruction using 4-strand hamstring tendon: A cross-sectional study with 1-year follow-up
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary Background: Antero-medial portal (AMP) and trans-tibial (TT) techniques are the most widely used methods for drilling femoral tunnel in ACL reconstructions; yet, debate continues about the preferred method. This study seeks to compare these 2 techniques in patients with ACL tears. Material/Methods: In this comparative study, all cases of isolated ACL reconstruction using 4-strand hamstring tendon in 2006–2010 were evaluated for eligibility. Of 266 patients, 124 cases (60 TT and 64 AMP), with the mean age of 28.48±8.3, met the inclusion criteria. Both groups were compared in 8 follow-ups from the point of view of time of: return to post-surgical activities (including walking without crutches, normal life activity, jogging, and exercising), maximum range of passive movements, knee instability (Lachman test), functional condition (subjective IKDC and Lysholm knee scores), therapeutic outcomes, and patient’s satisfaction with treatment (VAS). Results: AMP technique significantly accelerates patients’ return to activity. AMP patients achieved full

TI  - Arthroscopic Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Using Bone–Patellar Tendon–Bone Autograft A Minimum 10-Year Follow-up
PY  - 2008
AB  - BackgroundAnterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery and technique have changed over the past decade.HypothesisModern arthroscopic management of an anterior cruciate ligament tear using patellar tendon autograft offers a high Patient satisfaction rate and good clinical results over the long term. However, it may be associated with osteoarthritis changes over time.Study DesignCase series; Level of evidence, 4.MethodsIn 1992, a prospective computerized database of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was established. Since that time, 101 anterior cruciate ligament arthroscopic reconstructions performed at our institution have been observed. Inclusion criteria were as follows: reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, a minimum 10-year follow-up, a standardized operative procedure, and no previous anterior cruciate ligament repair or associated ligament lesions. Before surgery, the mean age of the patients was 28.8 years ± 8.3 (mean ± SD). The follow-up assessment was established using...

TI  - Treatment of focal articular cartilage defects in the knee: a systematic review.
PY  - 2008
AB  - We asked whether autologous chondrocyte implantation or osteochondral autograft transfer yields better clinical outcomes compared with one another or with traditional abrasive techniques for treatment of isolated articular cartilage defects and whether lesion size influences this clinical outcome. We performed a literature search and identified five randomized, controlled trials and one prospective comparative trial evaluating these treatment techniques in 421 patients. The operative procedures included autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral autograft transfer, matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation, and microfracture. Minimum followup was 1 year (mean, 1.7 years; range, 1–3 years). All studies documented greater than 95% followup for clinical outcome measures. No technique consistently had superior results compared with the others. Outcomes for microfracture tended to be worse in larger lesions. All studies reported improvement in clinical outcome measures in all treatment groups when compared with preoperative assessment; however, no control (nonoperative) groups were used in any of the studies. A large prospective trial investigating these techniques with the addition of a control group would be the best way to definitively address the clinical questions.

TI  - Anteromedial versus transtibial tunnel drilling in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions: a systematic review.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose Failure to anatomically reconstruct the femoral footprint can lead to rotational instability and clinical failure. Thus we sought to compare femoral tunnel drilling techniques, specifically anteromedial (AM) and transtibial (TT) methods, with respect to rotational stability. Methods In this study we evaluated available scientific support for the ability of both techniques to achieve rotational stability of the knee through a systematic review of the literature for directly comparative biomechanical and clinical studies. Results We identified 9 studies (5 clinical Level II or III studies and 4 cadaveric studies) that directly compared AM and TT techniques. Three cadaveric and 2 clinical studies showed superior rotational stability with the AM technique as compared with the TT technique, whereas 2 cadaveric studies and 1 clinical study were unable to show any similar differences. Two studies showed superior clinical outcomes with the AM technique, whereas 3 studies were unable to show any difference. Conclusions In this systematic review of clinical and biomechanical studies directly comparing AM and TT techniques for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) in the literature, there are mixed results, with some studies finding superior rotational stability and clinical outcomes with the AM technique and some finding no difference. No studies showed significantly better results with the TT technique. This study shows that the AM portal technique for ACLR may be more likely to produce improved clinical and biomechanical outcomes but that the TT technique is capable of producing similar outcomes. Level of Evidence Level III, systematic review of Level II and III studies plus cadaver studies.

TI  - Predictive factors for 12-month outcome after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2008
AB  - There is a lack of knowledge regarding predictive factors for a successful clinical outcome after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The aim was to investigate pre-operative factors that may predict good outcomes as measured with the subscales Function in sports and recreation and Quality of life in Knee injury Osteoarthrithis Outcome Score (QOL-KOOS), one-leg hop test and Tegner Activity Scale 12 months after ACL reconstruction. Sixty-four patients, operated with either patellar or hamstring tendon graft, were included. Demographics, range of motion, anterior knee laxity, pivot shift, muscle-torques, anterior knee pain (AKP) and knee function were registered pre-operatively and used in a multiple regression model. Results show less degree of AKP and low influence on knee function to be the most important predictors for good outcome in Sport/Rec-KOOS (explained 31% of variances). Less AKP was in addition the most important predictor for QOL-KOOS (14%). Patellar-tendon graft, in favor of hamstring tendon graft, explained 8% of the improvement in the Tegner Activity Scale. In conclusion, a low degree of AKP was found to be the most important predictor for good clinical outcome 12 months after ACL reconstruction. Future studies, including psychological parameters, should use analyses that have the potential to control for independency between variables.

TI  - Anatomic Single- and Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, Part 2: Clinical Application of Surgical Technique
PY  - 2011
AB  - The anterior cruciate ligament has been and is of great interest to scientists and orthopaedic surgeons worldwide. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was initially performed using an open approach. When the approach changed from open to arthroscopic reconstruction, a 2- and, later, 1-incision technique was applied. With time, researchers found that traditional arthroscopic single-bundle reconstruction did not fully restore rotational stability of the knee joint and a more anatomic approach to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament has been proposed. Anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction intends to replicate normal anatomy, restore normal kinematics, and protect long-term knee health. Although double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has been shown to result in better rotational stability in both biomechanical and clinical studies, it is vital to differentiate between anatomic and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The latter is merely a step closer to reproducing the native anatomy of the anterior cruciate ligament; however, it can still be done nonanatomically. To evaluate the potential benefits of reconstructing the anterior cruciate ligament in an anatomic fashion, accurate, precise, and reliable outcome measures are needed. These include, for example, T2 magnetic resonance imaging mapping of cartilage and quantification of graft healing on magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, there is a need for a consensus on which patient-reported outcome measures should be used to facilitate homogeneous reporting of outcomes.

TI  - Knee Osteoarthritis After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Bone–Patellar Tendon–Bone Versus Hamstring Tendon Autograft: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials
PY  - 2018
AB  - Purpose The primary purpose of this study was to systematically review high-quality studies in the literature to compare the postoperative radiographic incidence of knee osteoarthritis (OA) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) versus hamstring tendon (HT) autograft. The secondary purpose of this study was to compare other symptoms of postoperative knee OA between these 2 groups through patient-reported outcome scores and knee range of motion. Methods A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library to locate randomized controlled trials that compared postoperative progression of knee OA in patients who had undergone ACLR with BPTB versus HT autograft. Search terms used were "anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction," "patellar tendon," "hamstring," "randomized," and "osteoarthritis." Patients were assessed based on radiographic evaluation (Kellgren-Lawrence, Ahlback, Fairbank, and the Objective International Knee Documentation Committee scales), patient-reported outcome scores (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and visual analog scale scores), graft failure, and active knee flexion and extension deficit. Results Eight studies (6 Level I, 2 Level II) were identified that met inclusion criteria, including a total of 237 and 268 nonoverlapping patients who had undergone ACLR with BPTB and HT autograft, respectively, with a mean follow-up of 11.5 years (range, 3-16 years). Graft failure was experienced by 7.0% of patients in each group ( P  = .99). A Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≥2 was found in 52.0% and 51.0% of BPTB and HT autograft patients, respectively ( P  = .85). An Ahlback and Fairbank grade ≥2 was found in 5.0% and 8.4% of BPTB and HT autograft patients, respectively ( P  = .36). There were no significant differences in any patient-reported outcomes between groups within any study. Conclusions Patients undergoing ACLR with BPTB autograft or HT autograft can be expected to experience a similar incidence of postoperative knee OA at long-term follow-up. Level of Evidence Level II, systematic review of Level I and II studies.

TI  - Early tunnel enlargement after arthroscopic ACL reconstructions.
PY  - 2007
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the tunnel enlargement phenomenon after ACL reconstructions performed with hamstrings tendons fixed using the cross pin technique. Sixty-two knees in 62 patients were followed for two years to evaluate the possible clinical implications of the femoral and tibial tunnel enlargements noted after ACL reconstruction. The reconstructions were done with hamstring tendons using the cross-pin technique. Evaluation was based on calculated clinical scores (IKDC and Lysholm knee scores) and quantified by KT-1000 measurements. Sagittal and coronal plane computed tomography and conventional radiography were performed 3 days after operation and were repeated after 3 and 6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months, to assess early tunnel enlargement. Although it seems that tunnel enlargement after ACL reconstruction has no impact on the clinical results, long-term implications and potential need for revision surgery must be assessed. In this study, tunnel enlargement was noted fairly early after operation and was thought to be related with drilling of the tunnels. A possible solution to this problem may be drilling the tunnels to a diameter 1 mm smaller than the measured graft diameter, then to enlarge the tunnels to the graft diameter with the appropriate tunnel dilator.

TI  - Saucerization Versus Complete Resection of a Symptomatic Discoid Lateral Meniscus at Short- and Long-term Follow-up: A Systematic Review.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the surgical outcomes of symptomatic discoid menisci after total meniscectomy, saucerization, and suture repair of tears of a discoid meniscus at short- and long-term follow-up. Methods A systematic review was conducted using the Pubmed and ScienceDirect databases in adherence with Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Short- and long-term follow-up were defined as an average follow-up of 4 years, respectively. Pooled quantitative synthesis was performed on studies that reported results of total meniscectomy and saucerization in the same study. A systematic review was performed on studies that reported data on saucerization, total meniscectomy, and/or repair. Results A total of 19 studies for the short term and 22 for the long term were identified that met inclusion criteria for qualitative review. Of these, 4 short-term and 5 long-term studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. No significant differences in Ikeuchi scores are seen in the short-term studies between saucerization and total meniscectomy; however, the long-term studies did find a statistical difference favoring saucerization ( P Conclusions Long-term data demonstrate significantly improved patient reported outcomes in favor of saucerization over total meniscectomy. Suture repair of tears of a lateral discoid meniscus does not demonstrate improved outcomes over partial meniscectomy without repair. Considering the cost of repair and lack of demonstrated improvement, based on the limited available data, we do not recommend repair of the abnormal anatomy in a torn lateral discoid meniscus.

TI  - Cross-pin femoral fixation versus metal interference screw fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring tendons: results of a controlled prospective randomized study with 2-year follow-up.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Purpose: To determine if there is a different clinical outcome after cross-pin versus interference screw fixation in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with hamstring tendons. Type of Study: Prospective randomized clinical follow-up study. Methods: Sixty-two patients were randomized into either TransFix cross-pin (Arthrex, Naples, FL) (TransFix group, n=31) or metal interference screw femoral fixation (screw group, n=31) in ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendons. The distal fixations were an AO screw with spiked washer post and metal interference screw. The evaluation methods were clinical examination, CA 4000 laxity (OSI, Hayward, CA), and Lido isokinetic muscle torque measurements (Lido MultiJoint II; Loredon, West Sacramento, CA) as well as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner activity level, Lysholm knee, and Kujala patellofemoral scores. Results: There were no differences between the study groups preoperatively. For the 2-year follow-up, 26 patients of the TransFix group and 30 patients of the screw group were available (90%). The evaluation methods disclosed no statistical differences between the groups at the 1- or 2-year follow-up examinations. At the 2-year follow-up, 22 (85%) of the TransFix and 22 (73%) of the screw group patients were in the IKDC A or B categories. There were significantly more additional procedures postoperatively in the TransFix group owing to the removal of the tibial fixation post hardware in 15 (48%) cases. Conclusions: There were no statistically or clinically relevant differences in the results 1 or 2 years postoperatively and both techniques seemed to improve patients' performance. Level of Evidence: Level I.

TI  - Double-Leg and Single-Leg Jump Test Reference Values for Athletes With and Without Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Who Play Popular Pivoting Sports, Including Soccer and Basketball: A Scoping Review.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To synthesize and present reference values for double-leg and single-leg jump tests in healthy athletes who play pivoting sports, and athletes with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) who play pivoting sports. <b>DESIGN:</b> Scoping review. <b>LITERATURE SEARCH:</b> We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science until April 7, 2023. <b>STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA:</b> We included reference values in 2 different categories: (1) double-leg and/or single-leg jump test outcomes in pivoting-sport athletes with ACLR at a specific time point during rehabilitation, and (2) double-leg and/or single-leg jump test outcomes in healthy pivoting-sport athletes. <b>DATA SYNTHESIS:</b> We performed data synthesis for reference values from double-leg jump tests (squat jump and countermovement jump) and single-leg jump tests (vertical hop, single hop for distance, triple hop for distance, crossover hop for distance, medial triple hop for distance, lateral triple hop for distance, 6-m timed hop, side hop, drop jump, and 10-second repeated hop) that were performed according to a standardized test description. We summarized the data for type of sport, sex, sport participation level, and age group. <b>RESULTS:</b> Of the 27 included studies, nine reported reference values from healthy soccer players, six from healthy basketball players, and eleven from other healthy pivoting-sport athletes. LSI dominant/nondominant (LSI-D/ND) ranged between 97% and 106% for healthy soccer players, and between 99% and 120% for healthy basketball players. Four studies reported reference values from pivoting-sport athletes with ACLR from 7 to 10 months postsurgery. <b>CONCLUSION:</b> This scoping review summarizes double-leg and single-leg jump test reference values for athletes who play common pivoting sports, including soccer and basketball. <i>J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2024;54(6):1-14.

AB  - Purpose. To translate, cross-culturally adapt and validate the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF-C) to Chinese.Method. Forward and backward translations were conducted by two bilingual professional translators. Content validity was verified by a panel of a senior orthopaedic surgeon and six physiotherapists. The IKDC-SKF-C was tested on 84 patients. Psychometric testing included internal consistency (Cronbach's α) and test–retest reliability. Convergent validity used Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho) tests by comparing its score with the Chinese version of SF-36.Results. The Internal consistency was excellent with Cronbach's α  ==  0.97. Test-retest reliability was supported with an ICC  ==  0.87. The IKDC-SKF-C was moderately related to concurrent measures of physical function and bodily pain (r  ==  0.64, p  <0.05).Conclusion. The translated Chinese IKDC-SKF is a reliable and valid tool with equal measurement properties and conceptual equivalent to the orig...

TI  - Changes in Isokinetic Muscle Strength of the Lower Extremity in Recreational Athletes With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2002
AB  - Objective: To investigate changes in muscle strength in the lower extremity after ACL reconstruction. Design: Prospective case series. Dependent Variables: Isokinetic muscle strength measured in 6 movements (hip extension/flexion, hip adduction/abduction, knee extension/flexion) and circumference of the thigh/calf. Setting: Clinic and home. Patients: 44 (24 men, 20 women) between the ages of 16 and 47 years with an ACL rupture. All underwent reconstruction via a semitendinosus autograft. Main Outcome Measures: The peak torque for each joint movement was recorded. Repeated-measures ANOVA and power analysis were conducted to detect significant interaction effects. Results: The decline of muscle strength after ACL reconstruction remained not only in the knee extensors and flexors but also in the hip adductors. Conclusion: Rehabilitation programs that address the behavioral patterns and physiological characteristics of an ACL injury will benefit the athlete’s whole body and lead to a full recovery.

TI  - Primary Repair for Posterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries An Eight-Year Followup of Fifty-three Patients
PY  - 1996
AB  - We reviewed 53 of 58 patients who had primary repairs of posterior cruciate ligament injuries between 1981 and 1988. Sixteen patients had isolated posterior cruciate ligament ruptures, 16 had complex injuries with capsular and collateral ligament involvement, and 21 had additional anterior cruciate ligament ruptures. Forty-six patients were treated by transosseous multiple-loop sutures and seven with bony avulsions by screw osteosynthesis. The mean follow-up time was 7.5 years (range, 3 to 12). All patients were examined subjectively (questionnaire) and objectively (clinical examination, KT-1000 arthrometer, functional testing, radiographs, and Cybex II isokinetic strength analysis). The results were graded according to the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form and the Lysholm score. The average Lysholm score was 82.4 (range, 40 to 100). Thirty-eight patients returned to their preinjury activities at the same intensity level. The patients' subjective assessments were normal or nearly normal in 35 patients. The posterior drawer test was negative or 1+ in 46 patients. Cybex isokinetic strength analysis revealed a decrease in quadriceps muscle strength of the involved limb by 10.5% (P < 0.01). Our data suggest that primary repair of posterior cruciate ligament ruptures provides good results after 8 years in approximately two thirds of the patients. Distal ligamentous ruptures, lack of athletic activity, and temporary olecranization correlated with poor results. Bony avulsions, midsubstance or proximal ruptures, and athletic activity correlated with good results.

PY  - 2021
AB  - BACKGROUND Mosaicplasty osteochondral transplantation (MOT) has been proved a feasible choice for the treatment of talus osteochondral injury. It can reduce ankle pain and allow performance of daily living activities and elementary sports. However, there are very little data on the restoration of normal life with large lesions. Our investigation focused on assessing outcomes in patients with large lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS The MOT operation was used, and the donor site was located at the lateral condyle of the femur. Clinical evaluation included the Berndt and Harty outcome question, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score (during rest, walking and running), American Orthopedic Foot and ankle Association (AOFAS) score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation form, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36). Twenty-four months after surgery, the graft binding was assessed by MRI using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score. RESULTS We assessed 26 patients, including 14 males and 12 females. The average follow-up time was 33.9±5.2 months. The average lesion size was 173.1±23.5 mm². The average VAS score during rest improved from 4.62±0.85 preoperatively to 1.08±0.27 postoperatively (P<0.05), the score during walking improved from 5.19±0.63 preoperatively to 1.15±0.37 postoperatively (P<0.05), and the score during running improved from 6.08±0.74 preoperatively to 1.39±0.57 postoperatively (P<0.05). The average postoperative AOFAS ankle score improved to 91.5±2.6 (range, 88 to 96), compared with preoperative 75.0±2.8 (range, 70 to 79) (P<0.05). Two patients developed pain in the donor site of the knee joint, and both of them had 2 or more osteochondral plugs harvested. The postoperative SF-36 score increased to 92.2±2.4 (P<0.05). In the last follow-up, 18 patients answered the Berndt and Harty outcome question, all with "good" as the result. CONCLUSIONS MOT is a feasible choice for patients with larger lesions. It can improve the VAS/AOFAS/IKDC/SF-36 scores, and has high patient satisfaction. Graft incorporation helps improve patient quality of life. Our results indicate that a larger osteochondral plug area increases the risk of developing knee donor site pain.

TI  - Comparing Sagittal-Plane Biomechanics of Drop Jump Landing in Athletes With and Without Knee Osteoarthritis 2-Year Post-Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2024
AB  - The study aimed to determine differences in sagittal-plane joint biomechanics between athletes with and without knee osteoarthritis (OA) during drop vertical jump 2 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Forty-one athletes with ACLR completed motion analysis testing during drop vertical jump from 30 cm. Sagittal-plane peak joint angles and moments and joint contributions to total support moment (TSM) were calculated during first landing. Medial compartment knee OA of the reconstructed knee was evaluated using Kellgren-Lawrence scores (ACLR group: Kellgren-Lawrence <2; ACLR-OA group: Kellgren-Lawrence ≥2). The ACLR-OA group (n = 13) had higher hip and lower knee contributions in the surgical limb than the ACLR group and their nonsurgical limb. Further, the ACLR-OA group had higher peak hip extension moment than the ACLR group (P = .024). The ACLR-OA group had significantly lower peak knee extension and ankle plantar flexion moments and TSM (P ≤ .032) than ACLR group. The ACLR-OA group landed with increased hip extension moment, decreased knee extension and ankle plantar flexion moments and TSM, and decreased knee and increased hip contributions to TSM compared with ACLR group. The ACLR-OA group may have adopted movement patterns to decrease knee load and compensated by shifting the load to the hip. Clinicians may incorporate tailored rehabilitation programs that mitigate the decreased knee load to minimize the risk of knee OA after ACLR.

TI  - The Cochrane Library - One‐incision versus two‐incision techniques for arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in adults
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are serious knee injuries that are frequently treated surgically in the form of arthroscopically assisted reconstruction with grafts from the patella or hamstrings tendons. We reviewed the evidence for the choice of arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction technique in terms of whether it should involve one incision (femoral tunnel drilled from inside the knee joint under arthroscopic visualisation) or two incisions (femoral tunnel drilled from outside to inside the knee joint). Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of one-incision versus two-incision techniques for arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, reference lists, and conference abstracts. The date of the search was 16 August 2017. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating one-incision versus two-incision techniques for arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently searched and selected studies, and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the eligible studies. We undertook limited pooling of data using the fixed-effect model. Main results We included five trials (four randomised and one quasi-randomised) evaluating a total of 320 participants who were mainly in their 20s. All participants underwent ACL reconstruction with patella tendon grafts. All five included trials were at a high risk of bias, particularly performance bias. Based on these limitations and the insufficiency of the available data resulting in imprecision of effect estimates, we judged the quality of the evidence as very low for all outcomes. This means that we are uncertain of the findings of the review.We found very low-quality evidence of no clinically important differences between the two techniques in self reported knee function, measured using the Lysholm knee score (scale 0 to 100: best outcome), at short-term (3 months) (mean difference (MD) 2.73 favours one-incision technique, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.70 to 8.15; 79 participants, 2 studies), intermediate-term (12 months) (MD -3.68 favours two-incision technique, 95% CI -6.61 to -0.75; 79 participants, 2 studies), and long-term follow-up. The data available for long-term follow-up (2 to 5 years) was expressed in terms of the numbers of participants with excellent Lysholm scores (90 points or more); we found no difference between the two groups (42/45 versus 36/40; risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.18; 1 study). There were no data for quality of life measures or for overall numbers of participants incurring an adverse event. We found very low-quality evidence of little between-group differences in individual adverse events such as infection, knee stiffness, reoperation, and graft failure.We found very low-quality evidence from one study (59 participants) of little difference between the two groups in activity levels measured using Tegner scores (scale 0 to 10: highest sport activity) at two years (MD -0.80 favours two-incision technique, 95% CI -1.90 to 0.30). There was very low-quality evidence from four studies of minimal between-group difference in the number of participants with normal or nearly normal objectively measured knee function (International Knee Documentation Committee objective assessment grading) at intermediate follow-up (means 12 to 28 months): 56/78 versus 63/89; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.21; 167 participants). Authors' conclusions The very low-quality and often absent evidence means that we are uncertain whether one-incision arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction techniques yield better, worse, or equivalent results compared with two-incision techniques in terms of short-, intermediate-, or long-term subjective function, quality of life, adverse outcomes, activity levels, and objectively rated knee function. The evidence was available only for single-bundle ACL reconstruction using patella tendon grafts.When considering priorities for high-quality randomised trials on techniques for ACL reconstruction, it is important to note the insufficiency of the evidence available to inform this key comparison.

TI  - The Relationship Between Passive Joint Laxity and Functional Outcome After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury
PY  - 1997
AB  - Twenty patients with anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees were studied. Ten patients returned to all sports activities (compensators) and 10 patients were not improved with nonoperative management and required surgical stabilization (noncompensators). Joint laxity was measured using a KT-2000 arthrometer (manual maximum Lachman). Subjects completed a Lysholm questionnaire and Knee Outcome Score. The International Knee Documentation Committee form was also completed. Patients also rated their knee function on a scale of 1 to 100. There was no difference in level and frequency of athletic activity between the two groups before their anterior cruciate ligament injuries as determined by the knee outcome score. The compensator group had a mean side-to-side difference of 3.25 mm at 89 N and the noncompensators had a mean difference of 3 mm preoperatively. Manual maximum tests gave side-to-side differences of 6.7 mm for the compensators and 6 mm for the noncompensators. There were no differences in laxity measures between groups. The correlation between knee outcome scores and side-to-side laxity measurements were not significant. Measurements of anterior laxity in anterior cruciate ligament-deficient patients were not correlated with measures of functional outcome used in this study. Functional outcome measurements that are partially based on joint laxity measures, such as the International Knee Documentation Committee form, may artificially overestimate the disability after anterior cruciate ligament rupture.

TI  - Staged arthroscopic reconstructive surgery for multiple ligament injuries of the knee.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose. To review treatment outcome of our staged protocol for multiple ligament injuries of the knee.Methods. 21 men who were treated for multiple ligament injuries of the knee and had completed at least one year of rehabilitation were evaluated.Patients were examined under anaesthesia and then by diagnostic arthroscopy. Arthroscopic reconstructive procedures for injured cruciate ligaments were performed after a minimum 110o flexion and full extension were regained. Collateral ligaments injuries were treated first, followed by posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and then anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. Outcome was evaluated using the Lysholm knee score and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee ligament evaluation form.Results. 19 patients aged 24 to 55 (mean, 36) years were followed up for a mean of 22 (range, 14–33) months.The mean Lysholm score was 92. The mean scores for patients treated within and after 3 weeks were 93 and 90, respectively. The overall IKDC grading was B in 15 knees and C and D each in 2 knees. For the 2 patients with grade D, one presented 19 months after the injury and had persistent posterior sag (secondary to capsular contracture). His Lysholm score was 82.The second patient developed a deep infection and endured a flexion loss of 30o but had a satisfactory Lysholm score of 94. There was no significant difference between early and delayed treatments and between low- and high-velocity injuries in terms of the Lysholm score, the IKDC grade, the range of movement, and the functional outcome. Conclusion. Staged management of multiple ligament injuries of the knee enabled satisfactory restoration of function, stability, and range of movement in most of our patients. By staging the procedures, the need for subsequent ACL reconstruction can be better evaluated, as ACL reconstruction is not necessary in patients not undertaking strenuous activities.

TI  - Association of Quadriceps Strength Symmetry and Surgical Status with Clinical Osteoarthritis 5 Years after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Objective The objective of this study was to examine the association of quadriceps strength symmetry and surgical status (ACL reconstruction or nonoperative management) with early clinical knee OA 5 years after ACL injury or reconstruction. Methods 204/300 athletes were analyzed 5 years after ACL injury or reconstruction (ACLR). Quadriceps strength was measured and reported as a limb symmetry index. We identified participants with early clinical knee OA using criteria that two of four Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales score ≤85% (Luyten et al. 2018). We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, meniscal injury, and BMI, to examine the associations between quadriceps strength and surgical status with clinical knee OA. Results 21% of participants met KOOS criteria for clinical knee OA (Luyten et al. 2018). For every 1% increase in quadriceps limb symmetry index, there was 4% lower odds of clinical OA (adjusted OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99) at 5 years. Surgical status was not associated with clinical knee OA (adjusted OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.23, 1.50). Conclusions More symmetrical quadriceps strength, but not surgical status, 5 years after ACL injury or reconstruction was associated with lower odds of clinical knee OA.

TI  - In Vivo Measurement of the Pivot-Shift Test in the Anterior Cruciate Ligament–Deficient Knee Using an Electromagnetic Device
PY  - 2007
AB  - BackgroundThe pivot-shift test is commonly used for assessing dynamic instability in anterior cruciate ligament—insufficient knees, which is related to subjective knee function, unlike static load-displacement measurement. Conventional measurements of 3-dimensional position displacement cannot assess such dynamic instability in vivo and produce comparable parameters. Not only 3-dimensional position displacement but also its 3-dimensional acceleration should be measured for quantitative evaluation of the pivot-shift test.HypothesisKnees with a positive pivot-shift test result have increased tibial anterior translation and acceleration of its subsequent posterior translation, and they are correlated with clinical grading.Study DesignControlled laboratory study.Materials and MethodsThirty patients with isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury were included. Pivot-shift tests were evaluated under anesthesia manually and experimentally using an electromagnetic knee 6 degrees of freedom measurement system. Fr...

TI  - The Graft Insertion Length in the Femoral Tunnel During Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Suspensory Fixation and Tibialis Anterior Allograft Does Not Affect Surgical Outcomes but Is Negatively Correlated With Tunnel Widening.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Purpose To investigate the surgical outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using a low-dose irradiated tibialis anterior allograft with a fixed-loop cortical suspension device for the femur based on the graft insertion length (GIL) in the femoral tunnel. Methods Between January 2010 and January 2018, the medical records of consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with a tibialis anterior allograft fixed with the EndoButton CL for the femur and who had at least 2 years of follow-up were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were classified into 3 groups based on the GIL in the femoral tunnel (group 1, GIL 20 mm), and their functional scores, knee laxity, and radiographic parameters were evaluated. Results A total of 91 patients were analyzed. There were no statistically significant differences in the functional scores and knee laxity between the 3 groups at 2 years postoperatively. However, significant differences were observed in tunnel widening at 1 year postoperatively in the femur (P = .045 for absolute value and P = .004 for relative value) and the tibia (P = .014 for absolute value and P = .012 for relative value), revealing that both the femoral and tibial tunnels widened as the GIL decreased. Additional linear regression analyses were performed to identify whether the GIL independently affects tunnel widening. Consequently, the femoral tunnel depth, tunnel diameter, and GIL were found to independently influence femoral tunnel widening (P = .008, P = .019, and P Conclusions The GIL in the femoral tunnel during ACL reconstruction using a tibialis anterior allograft with a fixed-loop cortical suspension device for the femur has no significant association with the postoperative functional outcomes and knee laxity, but it has a negative correlation with tunnel widening in the femur and the tibia.

TI  - Anterolateral Proximal Tibial Opening Wedge Osteotomy to Treat Symptomatic Genu Recurvatum with Valgus Alignment: A Case Report.
PY  - 2014
AB  - A proximal tibial medial opening wedge osteotomy is commonly used to treat combined genu varus and medial compartment osteoarthritis1-3. Additionally, the ability to perform both coronal and sagittal plane corrections makes these osteotomies useful in treating chronic complex knee ligament instabilities4-13.

Valgus-producing proximal medial opening or lateral closing wedge tibial osteotomies have been performed for chronic combined varus alignment and cruciate or collateral ligament injuries1,11,14. While closing wedge techniques provide the advantage of direct bone surface apposition, opening wedge osteotomies reportedly facilitate more precise angular corrections15. Moreover, an opening wedge osteotomy is preferred when an increase in the posterior tibial slope is desired because it tends to increase posterior tibial slope16-19, while a closing wedge osteotomy tends to decrease posterior tibial slope20,21.

Patients with valgus coronal plane malalignment are commonly treated with a distal femoral osteotomy22. This technique, however, does not allow concomitant correction of sagittal-plane tibial slope. A lateral tibial-based opening wedge osteotomy to increase posterior tibial slope and correct genu valgus can be useful, yet remains infrequently discussed23,24. This case report describes the surgical technique for and outcomes after an anterolateral proximal tibial osteotomy for symptomatic genu recurvatum and valgus alignment.

The patient was informed that data concerning the case would be submitted for publication, and she provided consent.

A twenty-two-year-old woman presented with left knee pain and instability following a motorcycle accident one year prior. She had experienced a hyperextension injury of the left knee, which had resulted in persistent instability despite considerable rehabilitation. Lateral movements, in particular, produced knee hyperextension and giving way. Despite more than a year of physical therapy, the left knee instability remained …

TI  - Clinical Outcomes of Arthroscopic Primary Repair of Proximal Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears Are Maintained at Mid-term Follow-up.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Purpose To assess the mid-term clinical outcomes in patients with proximal avulsion anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears undergoing arthroscopic primary repair with suture anchors. Methods The first 11 consecutive patients with proximal avulsion tears treated with arthroscopic primary repair were evaluated at mid-term (minimum 5-year) follow-up. Physical examination was performed; laxity examination consisting of the Lachman, pivot-shift, and anterior drawer tests was performed; and patients were asked to complete the Lysholm, modified Cincinnati, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) questionnaires. Results Of the 11 patients, 10 were seen at a mean follow-up of 6.0 ± 1.5 years (range, 4.8-9.2 years). One patient was lost to follow-up, in whom failure had already occurred at short-term follow-up. One additional patient underwent reoperation for a medial meniscus tear and also had a partial ACL tear; this patient was clinically stable at last follow-up. All patients had full range of motion. Nine patients had negative Lachman and negative pivot-shift examination findings (IKDC score of A), and 1 patient had a 1A Lachman result and 1+ pivot-shift result (IKDC score of B). The mean Lysholm score was 96.0 ± 4.5 (range, 88-100); modified Cincinnati score, 95.6 ± 7.4 (range, 80-100); Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, 95.4 ± 5.4 (range, 85-100); preinjury Tegner score, 7.2 ± 1.2 (range, 5-9); postoperative Tegner score, 6.6 ± 1.8 (range, 3-9); and IKDC subjective score, 92.3 ± 11.3 (range, 64-100). Conclusions The clinical outcomes of arthroscopic primary repair of proximal ACL tears with suture anchors are excellent and are maintained at mid-term follow-up in a carefully selected subset of patients with proximal tears and excellent tissue quality. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Functional outcomes following a non-operative treatment algorithm for anterior cruciate ligament injuries in skeletally immature children 12 years and younger. A prospective cohort with 2 years follow-up
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background The methodological quality of studies on treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in skeletally immature children after ACL injury is low, and no prospective studies have evaluated the functional outcomes following a non-operative treatment algorithm. Purpose To report changes in knee function and activity level in skeletally immature children following a non-operative treatment algorithm for a minimum of 2 years after ACL injury. Study design Prospective cohort. Methods 46 skeletally immature children aged 12 years and younger were evaluated at baseline and subsequent yearly follow-ups using patient-reported outcome measurements, isokinetic muscle strength measurements, single-legged hop tests and clinical examinations over a minimum period of 2 years. Participation in physical activities was monitored using a monthly online activity survey, and the main leisure-time sport activity was registered at the yearly follow-ups. Results 36 (78%) of the children did not undergo an ACL reconstruction during the follow-up. Statistically significant changes with questionable clinical relevance were discovered with the patient-reported outcome measurements or hop tests. Leg symmetry indexes were consistently above 90% for muscle strength and single legged hop tests throughout the study, and the isokinetic muscle strength improved significantly in the injured limb. Ninety-one per cent maintained participation in pivoting sports and/or physical education in school, although 38% of the ACL deficient children changed their main activity from a level 1 to a level 2 activity. Conclusions A non-operative treatment algorithm may be appropriate for ACL injured skeletally immature children, although a reduced participation in level 1 activities may be necessary for some children.

TI  - Quadriceps strength and weight acceptance strategies continue to improve two years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2011
AB  - The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most commonly-injured knee ligament during sporting activities. After injury, most individuals experience episodes of the knee giving way during daily activities (non-copers). Non-copers demonstrate asymmetrical quadriceps strength and movement patterns, which could have long-term deleterious effects on the integrity of the knee joint. The purpose of this study was to determine if non-copers resolve their strength and movement asymmetries within two years after surgery. 26 non-copers were recruited to undergo pre-operative quadriceps strength testing and 3-dimensional gait analysis. Subjects underwent surgery to reconstruct the ligament followed by physical therapy focused on restoring normal range of motion, quadriceps strength, and function. Subjects returned for quadriceps strength testing and gait analysis six months and two years after surgery. Acutely after injury, quadriceps strength was asymmetric between limbs, but resolved six months after surgery. Asymmetric knee angles, knee moments, and knee and hip power profiles were also observed acutely after injury and persisted six months after surgery despite subjects achieving symmetrical quadriceps strength. Two years after surgery, quadriceps strength in the involved limb continued to improve and most kinematic and kinetic asymmetries resolved. These findings suggest that adequate quadriceps strength does not immediately resolve gait asymmetries in non-copers. They also suggest that non-copers have the capacity to improve their quadriceps strength and gait symmetry long after ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Double compared with single-bundle open inlay posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in a cadaver model.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Background: There is considerable controversy regarding whether a double-bundle reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament is superior to single-bundle techniques. The purpose of this study was to compare posterior tibial translation and external rotation following double and single-bundle tibial inlay reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament in both a posterolateral corner-deficient and a repaired cadaver model.

Methods: Posterior drawer testing, dial testing, and stress radiography were performed on nine cadaver knees. The intact knees served as controls. The posterior cruciate ligament and the posterolateral corner structures were resected, and each knee then underwent a double-bundle reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament. Following testing, both with and without the posterolateral corner repaired, the posteromedial bundle was released and the knee was retested with a single-bundle reconstruction.

Results: With dial testing, external rotation measured a mean (and standard error) of 7.6° ± 0.4° at 30° of knee flexion and 9.0° ± 0.8° at 90° after the double-bundle reconstruction with posterolateral corner repair, and it measured 11.2° ± 1.4° at both 30° and 90° after the single-bundle reconstruction with posterolateral corner repair. When dial testing was performed after the double-bundle reconstruction without posterolateral corner repair, external rotation measured a mean of 15.8° ± 1.9° at 30° and 16.9° ± 2.0° at 90°; after the single-bundle reconstruction without posterolateral corner repair, it measured 20.1° ± 1.8° at 30° and 20.3° ± 1.7° at 90°. Without posterolateral corner repair, the double-bundle reconstruction permitted significantly less external rotation than did the single-bundle reconstruction at 30° (p = 0.03). Stress radiography showed the mean posterior displacement after the double-bundle reconstruction with posterolateral corner repair to be 3.3 ± 1.4 mm. This value was not significantly different from the mean posterior displacement of 4.8 ± 1.0 mm after the single-bundle reconstruction with posterolateral corner repair, and both values were similar to that for the intact control (2.9 ± 0.5 mm) (p = 0.254). However, the single-bundle reconstruction without posterolateral corner repair was associated with significantly increased posterior displacement when compared with the intact controls (p = 0.039) and with the double-bundle reconstruction without posterolateral corner repair (p = 0.026).

Conclusions: Double-bundle reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament offers measurable benefits in terms of rotational stability and posterior translation in the setting of an untreated posterolateral corner injury. With the posterolateral corner intact, at time zero, the double-bundle reconstruction used in this study provided more rotational constraint to the knee at 30° and it did not further reduce posterior translation.

Clinical Relevance: Compared with single-bundle reconstruction, double-bundle reconstruction provided increased rotational and posterior control, which was most pronounced in the setting of an untreated posterolateral corner injury. This increased stability may be beneficial in the common clinical setting, in which these reconstructions tend to stretch over time. On the other hand, the persistence of the rotational overconstraint at 30° of knee flexion seen with the double-bundle reconstruction in this study may be a risk factor for osteoarthritis.

TI  - Comparison of traditional and subcutaneous patellar tendon harvest. A prospective study of donor site-related problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using different graft harvesting techniques.
PY  - 2000
AB  - Our goal was to compare the results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using either the traditional one-incision or the subcutaneous two-incision technique to harvest the central third of the patellar tendon, particularly concerning disturbances in anterior knee sensitivity and the patient's ability to walk on his or her knees. One surgeon performed anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on 124 patients with unilateral ruptures and no history of previous incisions in the anterior knee region. The traditional one-incision graft harvesting technique was used in 58 patients and the subcutaneous two-incision technique was used in 66 patients. At 2 years, the International Knee Documentation Committee classification, Lysholm score, arthrometry side-to-side difference, and single-legged hop test showed no significant differences between groups. The area of insensitivity was a median of 24 cm2 in the traditional harvest group and 0 cm2 in the subcutaneous harvest group. The patients with subcutaneous harvest had a tendency toward fewer problems during walking on their knees than did the patients with traditional harvest. Our conclusion is that the subcutaneous two-incision graft harvesting technique caused less disturbance in anterior knee sensitivity and a tendency of less discomfort during walking on one's knees than the traditional one-incision technique.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">This study aimed to investigate the microstructural and mechanical properties of semitendinosus tendon graft tissues during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and the clinical outcomes in skeletally immature and mature patients.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Twenty-two patients who underwent primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a hamstring tendon graft were analyzed and divided into skeletally immature (n = 7) and mature groups (n = 15) based on magnetic resonance imaging findings of the epiphyseal plate of the distal femur. Tissue samples were collected from the mid-portion of the semitendinosus tendon. The collagen fibril diameter, maximum stress, and strain at maximum stress point in the semitendinosus tendon tissues were calculated for comparison of the microstructural and mechanical properties between the two groups. Postoperative outcomes were also assessed between the two groups.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The mean and 60th and 80th percentiles of fibril diameters in the skeletally immature group were significantly smaller than those in the mature group (65.9 ± 13.0, 73.5 ± 19.3, and 91.3 ± 27.4 nm in the skeletally immature group; and 90.3 ± 14.7, 94.0 ± 18.4, and 125.3 ± 19.9 nm in the skeletally immature group; p = 0.001, 0.024, and 0.004, respectively). Additionally, the strain at maximum stress was higher in the skeletally immature group (237.2 ± 102.4% vs. 121.5 ± 51.9%, p = 0.024). However, there was no difference in maximum stress between the skeletally immature and mature groups (19.9 ± 14.3 MPa vs. 24.5 ± 23.4 MPa, p = 0.578). Strain was negatively correlated with the mean fibril diameter and the 60th and 80th percentiles of fibril diameters, whereas stress was positively correlated with the mean fibril diameter.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Biomechanical Assessment of Knee Ligament Ruptures
PY  - 2016
AB  - The complex biomechanics of the human knee joint are the result of an equilibrium of forces exerted by its surrounding soft tissue structures. When one of these forces is removed, as is the case when a ligament ruptures, a redistribution of forces occurs and the biomechanical properties of the knee are altered. One of the most frequently diagnosed knee ligament ruptures is that of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Such a rupture causes increased laxity of the knee joint as well as a complex rotational and translational instability whereby many patients describe a feeling that their knee is slipping, or “giving way.

TI  - The Cochrane Library - Patellar tendon versus hamstring tendon autograft for anterior cruciate ligament rupture in adults
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background
Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) commonly involves patellar tendon (PT) or hamstring tendon(s) (HT) autografts. There is no consensus with respect to the choice between these two grafts in ACL surgery.

Objectives
This review compared the outcomes of ACL reconstruction using PT versus HT autografts in ACL deficient patients.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (April 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2008, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 10 2008), EMBASE (1980 to April 10 2008), conference proceedings and reference lists. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection criteria
Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing outcomes (minimum two year follow-up) following ACL reconstruction using either PT or HT autografts in skeletally mature adults, irrespective of the number of bundles, fixation method or incision technique.

Data collection and analysis
After independent study selection, the four authors independently assessed trial quality and risk of bias, and extracted data using pre-developed forms. Trial authors were contacted for additional data and information. Risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcomes.

Main results
Nineteen trials providing outcome data for 1597 young to middle-aged adults were included. Many trials were at high risk of bias reflecting inadequate methods of randomization, lack of blinding and incomplete assessment of outcome.

Pooled data for primary outcomes, reported in a minority of trials, showed no statistically significant differences between the two graft choices for functional assessment (single leg hop test), return to activity, Tegner and Lysholm scores, and subjective measures of outcome. There were also no differences found between the two interventions for re-rupture or International Knee Documentation Committee scores. There were inadequate long-term results, such as to assess the development of osteoarthritis.

All tests (instrumental, Lachman, pivot shift) for static stability consistently showed that PT reconstruction resulted in a more statically stable knee compared with HT reconstruction. Conversely, patients experienced more anterior knee problems, especially with kneeling, after PT reconstruction. PT reconstructions resulted in a statistically significant loss of extension range of motion and a trend towards loss of knee extension strength. HT reconstructions demonstrated a trend towards loss of flexion range of motion and a statistically significant loss of knee flexion strength. The clinical importance of the above range of motion losses is unclear.

Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on differences between the two grafts for long-term functional outcome. While PT reconstructions are more likely to result in statically stable knees, they are also associated with more anterior knee problems.

TI  - Transphyseal reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in prepubescent children
PY  - 2008
AB  - We present the results of 17 children of Tanner stage 1 or 2 who underwent reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament between 1999 and 2006 using a transphyseal procedure, employing an ipsilateral four-strand hamstring graft. The mean age of the children was 12.1 years (9.5 to 14). The mean follow-up was 44 months (25 to 100). Survival of the graft, the functional outcome and complications were recorded. There was one re-rupture following another injury. Of the remaining patients, all had good or excellent results and a normal International Knee Documentation Committee score. The mean post-operative Lysholm score was 97.5 (SD 2.6) and the mean Tegner activity scale was 7.9 (SD 1.4). One patient had a mild valgus deformity which caused no functional disturbance. No other abnormality or discrepancy of leg length was seen. Measurements with a KT1000 arthrometer showed no significant difference between the normal and the operated legs. In this small series, transphyseal reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament appeared to be safe in these young children.

TI  - Operative and nonoperative management of anterior cruciate ligament injury: Differences in gait biomechanics at 5 years
PY  - 2020
AB  - Gait biomechanics after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury are associated with functional outcomes and the development of posttraumatic knee osteoarthritis. However, biomechanical outcomes between patients treated nonoperatively compared with operatively are not well understood. The primary purpose of this study was to compare knee joint contact forces, angles, and moments during loading response of gait between individuals treated with operative compared with nonoperative management at 5 years after ACL injury. Forty athletes treated operatively and 17 athletes treated nonoperatively completed gait analysis at 5 years after ACL reconstruction or completion of nonoperative rehabilitation. Medial compartment joint contact forces were estimated using a previously validated, patient-specific electromyography-driven musculoskeletal model. Knee joint contact forces, angles, and moments were compared between the operative and nonoperative group using mixed model 2 × 2 analyses of variance. Peak medial compartment contact forces were larger in the involved limb of the nonoperative group (Op: 2.37 ± 0.47 BW, Non-Op: 3.03 ± 0.53 BW; effect size: 1.36). Peak external knee adduction moment was also larger in the involved limb of the nonoperative group (Op: 0.25 ± 0.08 Nm/kg·m, Non-Op: 0.32 ± 0.09 Nm/kg·m; effect size: 0.89). No differences in radiographic tibiofemoral osteoarthritis were present between the operative and nonoperative groups. Overall, participants treated nonoperatively walked with greater measures of medial compartment joint loading than those treated operatively, while sagittal plane group differences were not present. Statement of clinical relevance: The differences in medial knee joint loading at 5 years after operative and nonoperative management of ACL injury may have implications on the development of posttraumatic knee osteoarthritis.

TI  - Assessing activity participation in the ACL injured population: a systematic review of activity rating scale measurement properties
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background: Participation is an important factor in assessing both the requirement for and outcome from anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Many patient-reported rating scales exist; however, measurement properties have not been well established.
Objective: To provide a systematic review to identify currently available activity rating scales for anterior cruciate ligament injured subjects and to evaluate current knowledge of their measurement properties.
Methods: Systematic searches of four databases (Medline, AMED, EMBASE, and CINAHL) without date or language restriction, using terms structured around the PICOS system were completed on 1st March 2011. Citation tracking, reference screening and contact with lead authors of key papers completed the search strategy. Studies using participation rating scales were identified to assess frequency of reporting and cited validation. Studies assessing one or more psychometric properties of the identified rating scales were subject to independent data extraction and critical appraisal by two independent authors using published tools.
Results: Thirty-one rating scales were identified from 241 outcome studies. Most scales were inadequately developed or validated prior to use. Only three scales (Tegner, CSAS, and Marx) had psychometric analysis in eight studies of mixed quality. Only the Tegner scale has adequate assessment of reliability, validity, and responsiveness. The use of type, intensity, and frequency variables in the identified scales is discussed.
Conclusions: The Tegner scale has been adequately validated; however, other rating scales require further validation. A comprehensive comparative analysis of clinical applicability and psychometric testing of existing scales, including clinically useful statistics, is required.

TI  - Return to sport and knee functional scores after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: 2 to 10 years' follow-up.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is one of the most common knee ligament reconstruction sustained by sports players. Previous studies have revealed different rates of returning to play sports depending on study sites, subjects, and time to follow-up; however, this subject has not been adequately investigated in Thailand. Objectives This study aimed to assess the percentage of ACL reconstruction patients who successfully returned to sport activities. Factors associated with being able to return to sport were also determined. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the rates of return to sport of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between 2005 and 2015. All potential patients were initially contacted via letter or mobile phone and asked to report their long-term follow-up outcomes. Collected data from the interview, including return to sport status, performance following ACL, and reasons for not returning to play (if applicable) were then combined with the initial surgical findings and enrollment/follow-up cohort data for analysis. This study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of Rajavithi Hospital. Results A total of 110 participants were recruited, with a mean age of 35.05 ± 9.16 years. Most of the patients were male, single, with bachelor degree education, engaged in "other" occupations, had income up to 10,000 baht/month, were in the social security scheme (54.5%), and had no underlying diseases (85.5%). The mean ± SD of BMI was 25.58 ± 4.30 kg/m2. When classified by whether or not they returned to sports, it was found that sex, education, income and underlying disease of those who returned to sport were significantly different from those of subjects who did not (p < 0.05). At follow-up, 36.4% had returned to sport. The main reasons stated for not returning to sport following ACL were fear of injury, concern about possible long-term effects, and worry about the possibility of re-injury. Overall, total IKDC scores of patients who returned to sport were significantly higher than those of subjects who did not. However, some points such as ability to kneel, ride and bend the knee were not different in the two groups. Bachelor degree education, monthly income lower than 10,000 Thai baht and IKDC score were the factors associated with returning to sport. Conclusions The rates of return to sport after ACL reconstruction were low compared to those of other reports in the literature. Education, low income and IKDC score were predictive factors of sport re-participation. Further studies should be carried out to assess the impact on treatment indications and rehabilitation.

TI  - Nonsurgical or Surgical Treatment of ACL Injuries: Knee Function, Sports Participation, and Knee Reinjury: The Delaware-Oslo ACL Cohort Study.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: While there are many opinions about the expected knee function, sports participation, and risk of knee reinjury following nonsurgical treatment of injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), there is a lack of knowledge about the clinical course following nonsurgical treatment compared with that after surgical treatment.

Methods: This prospective cohort study included 143 patients with an ACL injury. Isokinetic knee extension and flexion strength and patient-reported knee function as recorded on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 form were collected at baseline, six weeks, and two years. Sports participation was reported monthly for two years with use of an online activity survey. Knee reinjuries were reported at the follow-up evaluations and in a monthly online survey. Repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA), generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, and Cox regression analysis were used to analyze group differences in functional outcomes, sports participation, and knee reinjuries, respectively.

Results: The surgically treated patients (n = 100) were significantly younger, more likely to participate in level-I sports, and less likely to participate in level-II sports prior to injury than the nonsurgically treated patients (n = 43). There were no significant group-by-time effects on functional outcome. The crude analysis showed that surgically treated patients were more likely to sustain a knee reinjury and to participate in level-I sports in the second year of the follow-up period. After propensity score adjustment, these differences were nonsignificant; however, the nonsurgically treated patients were significantly more likely to participate in level-II sports during the first year of the follow-up period and in level-III sports over the two years. After two years, 30% of all patients had an extensor strength deficit, 31% had a flexor strength deficit, 20% had patient-reported knee function below the normal range, and 20% had experienced knee reinjury.

Conclusions: There were few differences between the clinical courses following nonsurgical and surgical treatment of ACL injury in this prospective cohort study. Regardless of treatment course, a considerable number of patients did not fully recover following the ACL injury, and future work should focus on improving the outcomes for these patients.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sport after Injury Scale (ACL-RSI) Scores over Time After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review with Meta-analysis.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Psychological readiness is an important consideration for athletes and clinicians when making return to sport decisions following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). To improve our understanding of the extent of deficits in psychological readiness, a systematic review is necessary.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To investigate psychological readiness (measured via the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury scale (ACL-RSI)) over time after ACL tear and understand if time between injury and surgery, age, and sex are associated with ACL-RSI scores.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Seven databases were searched from the earliest date available to March 22, 2022. Articles reporting ACL-RSI scores after ACL tear were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I, RoB-2, and RoBANS tools based on the study design. Evidence certainty was assessed for each analysis. Random-effects meta-analyses pooled ACL-RSI scores, stratified by time post-injury and based on treatment approach (i.e., early ACLR, delayed ACLR, and unclear approach).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 83 studies were included in this review (78% high risk of bias). Evidence certainty was 'weak' or 'limited' for all analyses. Overall, ACL-RSI scores were higher at 3 to 6 months post-ACLR (mean = 61.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 58.6, 64.4], I<sup>2</sup> = 94%) compared to pre-ACLR (mean = 44.4 [95% CI 38.2, 50.7], I<sup>2</sup> = 98%), remained relatively stable, until they reached the highest point 2 to 5 years after ACLR (mean = 70.7 [95% CI 63.0, 78.5], I<sup>2</sup> = 98%). Meta-regression suggests shorter time from injury to surgery, male sex, and older age were associated with higher ACL-RSI scores only 3 to 6 months post-ACLR (heterogeneity explained R<sup>2</sup> = 47.6%), and this reduced 1-2 years after ACLR (heterogeneity explained R<sup>2</sup> = 27.0%).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Psychological readiness to return to sport appears to improve early after ACL injury, with little subsequent improvement until ≥ 2-years after ACLR. Longer time from injury to surgery, female sex and older age might be negatively related to ACL-RSI scores 12-24 months after ACLR. Due to the weak evidence quality rating and the considerable importance of psychological readiness for long-term outcomes after ACL injury, there is an urgent need for well-designed studies that maximize internal validity and identify additional prognostic factors for psychological readiness at times critical for return to sport decisions.</AbstractText>

TI  - Results of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in the Adolescent Female
PY  - 2001
AB  - This study evaluated the functional results and complications of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery in adolescent females. We studied 22 consecutive female patients younger than 20 years who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Average follow-up was 31 months. One hundred percent of the patients were satisfied. Seven patients returned to intercollegiate or high school sports. The mean Lysholm score was 94, and the International Knee Documentation Committee score was 40% normal, 60% nearly normal. KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side differences were ≤3 mm in 90% of patients and between 3 and 5 mm in 10%. Quadriceps and hamstring strength was minimally decreased. One patient sustained a patella fracture. One patient changed her lifestyle because of her knee. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is successful in returning the female adolescent to competitive sports with a high degree of patient satisfaction and excellent functional outcome. Mild residual quadriceps and hamstring weakness may persist, however.

TI  - Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in skeletally immature patients : a systematic review.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Aims Different methods of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction
have been described for skeletally immature patients before closure
of the growth plates. However, the outcome and complications following
this treatment remain unclear. The aim of this systematic review
was to analyse the outcome and complications of different techniques
which may be used for reconstruction of the ACL in these patients. Materials and Methods We performed a systematic review of the literature according
to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
guidelines. This involved a comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline,
CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase and Google Scholar databases using the
following combinations of keywords, “knee”, “anterior cruciate ligament”,
“reconstruction”, “injury”, “children”, “adolescent”, “skeletally
immature”, “open physis” and “surgery”. Results A total of 53 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included
for analysis. The overall rate of disturbance of growth after ACL
reconstruction was 2.6%, with no statistical difference between
transphyseal and physeal-sparing techniques. Physeal-sparing techniques
had a lower rate of post-operative complications compared with transphyseal techniques
(p = 0.0045). Outcomes assessed were Lysholm score, International
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, the IKDC grade, the Tegner
score and the KT-1000. Both techniques had similar clinical outcomes. Conclusions This review reveals low rates of disturbance of growth after
ACL reconstruction in skeletally immature patients. Although limited,
the available evidence did not support any particular surgical technique
when considering disturbance of growth or clinical outcome. Further randomised
controlled trials are needed to investigate the efficacy of differing
surgical techniques on outcomes in skeletally immature patients. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2017;99-B:1053–60.

TI  - An Analysis of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Middle-Aged Patients:
PY  - 1997
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results and complications of anterior cruciate ligament surgery in middle-aged patients. Forty-five consecutive patients over 40 years old (average age, 44.6 years) who had arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions with midthird patellar tendon autografts were evaluated. The patients returned for interviews, physical examinations, radiographs, Biodex dynamometer strength testing, and KT-1000 arthrometer testing at an average of 37 months after their surgeries (range, 24 to 96 months). The mean Lysholm and Gillquist score was 91, which corresponds to symptoms only with vigorous activity. The overall scores from the International Knee Documentation Committee form were 29 (64%) normal or nearly normal and 2 (4%) severely abnormal. Side-to-side differences as determined by the KT-1000 arthrometer were 5 mm in 5 patients at 30 pounds of anterior displacement. Seventy-six percent of the patients (N = 34) returned to their preoperative activity levels. Three patients required repeat arthroscopic surgery for persistent knee pain and two patients had graft ruptures. This study shows that when middle-aged patients undergo surgery, their results can be successful and satisfying to a degree similar to those of younger patients.

TI  - The Pivot Shift: Current Experimental Methodology and Clinical Utility for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture and Associated Injury
PY  - 2019
AB  - The purpose of this manuscript is to (1) examine the history, techniques, and methodology behind quantitative pivot shift investigations to date and (2) review the current status of pivot shift research for its clinical utility for management of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture with associated injuries including the anterolateral complex (ALC). The pivot shift is a useful physical exam maneuver for diagnosis of rotatory instability related to ACL tear. Recent evidence suggests that the pivot shift is multifactorial and can be seen in the presence of ACL tear with concomitant injury to secondary stabilizers or with predisposing anatomical factors. The presence of a pivot shift post-operatively is associated with poorer outcomes after ACL reconstruction. Recent clinical and biomechanical investigations can help guide clinicians in utilizing pivot shift in diagnosis and surgical planning. Further research is needed to clarify optimal management of ALC in addition to ACL injury.

TI  - Online registration of monthly sports participation after anterior cruciate ligament injury: a reliability and validity study.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background The current methods measuring sports activity after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury are commonly restricted to the most knee-demanding sports, and do not consider participation in multiple sports. We therefore developed an online activity survey to prospectively record the monthly participation in all major sports relevant to our patient-group. Objective To assess the reliability, content validity and concurrent validity of the survey and to evaluate if it provided more complete data on sports participation than a routine activity questionnaire. Methods 145 consecutively included ACL-injured patients were eligible for the reliability study. The retest of the online activity survey was performed 2 days after the test response had been recorded. A subsample of 88 ACL-reconstructed patients was included in the validity study. The ACL-reconstructed patients completed the online activity survey from the first to the 12th postoperative month, and a routine activity questionnaire 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Results The online activity survey was highly reliable (κ ranging from 0.81 to 1). It contained all the common sports reported on the routine activity questionnaire. There was a substantial agreement between the two methods on return to preinjury main sport (κ=0.71 and 0.74 at 6 and 12 months postoperatively). The online activity survey revealed that a significantly higher number of patients reported to participate in running, cycling and strength training, and patients reported to participate in a greater number of sports. Conclusions The online activity survey is a highly reliable way of recording detailed changes in sports participation after ACL injury. The findings of this study support the content and concurrent validity of the survey, and suggest that the online activity survey can provide more complete data on sports participation than a routine activity questionnaire.

TI  - The optimal timing for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with respect to the risk of postoperative stiffness.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the risk of stiffness between early and delayed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery in studies that use a modern accelerated rehabilitation protocol. Methods Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched for studies that compared outcomes for early and delayed ACL reconstruction with a modern accelerated rehabilitation protocol. Risk ratios for stiffness were pooled using random effects meta-analysis. Results A total of 8 studies were included in this review. The 3 randomized trials found no difference in the risk of postoperative stiffness at cutoff points of Conclusions If a modern surgical technique and an accelerated rehabilitation protocol are used, there is no increased risk of knee stiffness if an ACL reconstruction is performed as early as 1 week after injury.

TI  - Determinants of patient satisfaction with outcome after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2002
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to identify the determinants of patient satisfaction with the outcome after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Methods: A cohort of 201 patients undergoing primary reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament was studied prospectively. All patients were followed for a minimum of two years (mean, 35.9 months). The dependent variable was patient satisfaction with the outcome, graded ordinally on a scale of 1 to 10. Nonparametric univariate analysis and multivariable modeling were performed to identify determinants of satisfaction.

Results: The demographic variables were not found to have a significant association (p > 0.05) with patient satisfaction. The variables at surgery demonstrated a significant association (p < 0.05) with patient satisfaction only with respect to the status of the lateral meniscus, the presence of osteophytes, and concurrent plica excision. The objective variables at follow-up revealed that patients were significantly less satisfied (p < 0.05) if they had a flexion contracture, increased laxity of the involved leg on the manual maximum test as measured on a KT-1000 device, an abnormal result on the pivot-shift examination, effusion, or tenderness at the medial joint line or patella. With regard to the subjective symptoms at follow-up, patients were found to be significantly (p < 0.05) less satisfied with the outcome if they had symptoms of pain, swelling, partial giving-way, full giving-way, locking, noise, stiffness, or a limp. Analysis of the subjective function at follow-up demonstrated that patients were significantly less satisfied (p < 0.05) with the outcome if they had a lower level of activity, sports activity, strenuous work, activities of daily living, overall knee function, sports participation, or symptom-free activity; if they were unemployed; or if they had difficulty with walking, squatting, ascending or descending stairs, running, jumping, cutting, or twisting. Patient satisfaction was significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the Lysholm knee score, overall International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee score, IKDC subjective subscore, IKDC symptoms subscore, and IKDC range-of-motion subscore. The seven independent multivariate determinants (adjusted R 2 = 0.83, p < 0.001) of patient satisfaction included the Lysholm score, overall subjective knee function, IKDC range-of-motion subscale, patellar tenderness, full giving-way, flexion contracture, and swelling.

Conclusions: Univariate and multivariate determinants of patient satisfaction with the outcome after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament were established. Although some specific surgical and objective variables were important, subjective variables of symptoms and function had the most robust associations with patient satisfaction. In assessing the outcome of reconstruction from the perspective of patient satisfaction with the outcome, we should emphasize patient-derived subjective assessment of symptoms and function, particularly those involving issues of stiffness, giving-way, swelling, and patellofemoral symptoms.

TI  - Anatomic risk factor for meniscal lesion in association with ACL rupture
PY  - 2019
AB  - To assess anatomic risk factors for meniscal lesions in association with acute ACL rupture. The primary hypothesis was that tibiofemoral anatomic measures will be different in those with and without concomitant meniscus tears. A retrospective review of patients who underwent acute ACL reconstruction in the department was performed. All patients underwent a postoperative CT scan. The concavity and/or convexity on the femur and the tibia were measured by two blinded observers on the sagittal plane with different ratios, and these measures were compared in patients with and without meniscus tears in each compartment. Intra- and inter-rater reliabilities were assessed. Four hundred twelve patients (268 males and 144 females) were included from October 2012 to February 2015. One hundred sixty-seven patients had a medial meniscal tear (119 males/48 females), and 100 had a lateral meniscal tear (80 males/20 females). The mean time from injury to surgery was 3 months. The average ICC for all measurements was 0.87 (range 0.82–0.98) indicating good reliability. The medial femoral condyle was noted to be significantly longer than the medial tibial plateau in the sagittal plane in patients with a medial meniscal tear (p = 0.04), and the lateral femoral condyle was noted to be significantly longer than the lateral tibial plateau in the sagittal plane in patients with a lateral meniscal tear (p <  0.001). In addition, a less convex lateral tibial plateau was statistically correlated with a higher risk of lateral meniscal tear (p = 0.001). A greater anteroposterior length of the medial/lateral femoral condyle relative to the medial/lateral tibial plateau is associated with an increased risk of meniscal lesions in association with acute ACL rupture. The lateral compartment in the male population appears to be the most at risk. Retrospectively registered on May 12, 2016 (CPP sud-est II CAL n°2016-037)

TI  - Persistence of the mini pivot shift after anatomically placed anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2007
AB  - We hypothesized that traces of pivot-shift instability (a minipivot) would persist after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in some knees despite objective restoration of anteroposterior laxity to normal. We tested intact cadaver knees after anterior cruciate ligament transection and then after anatomically placed single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions. We measured the rotational laxities and pivot-shift kinematics over a range of graft tensions. Increasing graft tension decreased anteroposterior laxity; anteroposterior laxity was greater than normal at 0 and 10 N tensions but not different than normal at 20 to 60 N tensions. Anterior cruciate ligament deficiency had little effect on rotation laxity, and reconstruction had little effect on rotational laxity, which was not reduced by increasing graft tension. During the pivot-shift test, increasing graft tension reduced the anteroposterior subluxation-reduction events, but tibial rotational was not restored to normal. More sophisticated reconstruction methods may be required to control rotation. Objective restoration of anteroposterior laxity to normal does not necessarily return knee kinematics, especially rotational behavior, to normal.

TI  - A placebo-controlled randomised trial to assess the effect of TGF-ß1-expressing chondrocytes in patients with arthritis of the knee.
PY  - 2015
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of injecting genetically engineered chondrocytes expressing transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) into the knees of patients with osteoarthritis. We assessed the resultant function, pain and quality of life. A total of 54 patients (20 men, 34 women) who had a mean age of 58 years (50 to 66) were blinded and randomised (1:1) to receive a single injection of the active treatment or a placebo. We assessed post-treatment function, pain severity, physical function, quality of life and the incidence of treatment-associated adverse events. Patients were followed at four, 12 and 24 weeks after injection. At final follow-up the treatment group had a significantly greater improvement in the mean International Knee Documentation Committee score than the placebo group (16 points; -18 to 49, vs 8 points; -4 to 37, respectively; p = 0.03). The treatment group also had a significantly improved mean visual analogue score at final follow-up (-25; -85 to 34, vs -11 points; -51 to 25, respectively; p = 0.032). Both cohorts showed an improvement in Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores, but these differences were not statistically significant. One patient had an anaphylactic reaction to the preservation medium, but recovered within 24 hours. All other adverse events were localised and resolved without further action. This technique may result in improved clinical outcomes, with the aim of slowing the degenerative process, leading to improvements in pain and function. However, imaging and direct observational studies are needed to verify cartilage regeneration. Nevertheless, this study provided a sufficient basis to proceed to further clinical testing.

TI  - All-Inside Meniscal Repair With Bioabsorbable Meniscal Screws or With Bioabsorbable Meniscus Arrows A Prospective, Randomized Clinical Study With 2-Year Results
PY  - 2010
AB  - BackgroundAll-inside meniscal repairs have gained popularity in the past few years. However, only a few prospective, randomized clinical studies have been done to compare different all-inside meniscal repair techniques.HypothesisMeniscal repair with bioabsorbable meniscal screws and arrows results in similar clinical outcome on short-term follow-up.Study DesignRandomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.MethodsForty-two patients were prospectively randomized to have all-inside meniscal repair either by using bioabsorbable meniscal screws or bioabsorbable meniscus arrows (21 patients, 23 meniscal repairs in each group) for the fixation. The evaluation methods were clinical examination, Lysholm score, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee score, and magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) evaluation. The average follow-up time was 27 months (standard deviation, 8).ResultsThere were no differences between the study groups preoperatively. All 42 patients (100%) were available for the ...

TI  - Geographic Mapping of Meniscus and Cartilage Lesions Associated with Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries
PY  - 2009
AB  - Background: Detailed descriptions of meniscus and articular cartilage lesions associated with anterior cruciate ligament injury have not been presented in the literature. Our goal was to determine the associations between patient sex, age, and surgical delay and the frequency and location of meniscus and articular cartilage lesions seen at the time of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Methods: Data were obtained retrospectively from a database of 1209 consecutive patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction between 1988 and 2002. All knee cartilage, meniscus, and ligament injuries were documented on anatomic maps at the time of surgery, and the data were analyzed.

Results: Meniscus injuries were identified in 722 (65%) of the 1104 patients who met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Female patients were less likely to have a meniscus injury than male patients were (56% compared with 71%), and male patients were more likely to have combined medial and lateral meniscus injuries than female patients were (20% compared with 11%). Patients with a surgical delay of less than three months were less likely to have a medial meniscus injury (8% compared with 19%). Femoral articular cartilage injuries were identified in 472 patients (43%). Patients who were twenty-five years of age or older were more likely to have multiple cartilage lesions throughout the knee (7.7% compared with 1.3%) and to have more isolated medial femoral condyle lesions (24.2% compared with 13.3%). Patients with a surgical delay of more than one year were more likely to have a lesion (60% compared with 47% for all others), and a surgical delay of more than one year resulted in a greater proportion of large and grade-3 lesions of the lateral femoral condyle. Female patients had a greater proportion of grade-1 lesions of the medial femoral condyle (29% compared with 16%), whereas male patients had a greater proportion of grade-3 and 4 lesions of the medial femoral condyle (49% compared with 35%). In patients who were thirty-five years of age or older, meniscus injuries were more frequent and were located more frequently on the medial side; femoral articular cartilage lesions were also located more frequently on the medial side.

Conclusions: Increased age, male sex, and increased surgical delay all increase the frequency and severity of injuries of the meniscus and/or articular cartilage after an anterior cruciate ligament tear.

Level of Evidence: Prognostic Level II. See Instructions to Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - 20-Year Outcomes of High Tibial Osteotomy: Determinants of Survival and Functional Outcome.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is a successful joint-preserving procedure for the treatment of medial compartment osteoarthritis. Long-term survivorship of HTO ranges from 40% to 85%. There are consistent factors that predict failure.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">To determine the 20-year survival of HTO and identify predictors of failure.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN">Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">A total of 100 consecutive patients with medial bone-on-bone arthritis were prospectively studied to provide long-term patient-reported outcome measures after lateral closing-wedge HTO and determine the time to failure. Failure was defined as conversion to arthroplasty (total knee arthroplasty or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty) or revision HTO.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">At 20 years, HTO survival was determined in 95 patients, and 5 were lost to follow-up. The overall survivorship of HTO at 20 years was 44%. The significant factors that were associated with better survivorship were age &lt;55 years, body mass index &lt;30, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score &gt;45. These factors were used to define the favorable candidates. In the favorable candidates, survivorship was 100% at 5 years, after which there was a gradual decline to 62% survival at 20 years. Of those with HTO survival, 32 of 33 (97%) reported satisfaction with surgery, with a mean Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Pain score of 91 and Activities of Daily Living score of 97.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">HTO is a successful surgical option to treat medial compartment osteoarthritis and prevent the need for arthroplasty in young patients. The most suitable candidates for HTO are aged &lt;55 years, are not obese, and have not progressed to severe symptomatic disability.</AbstractText>

TI  - Bundled payments in orthopedic surgery.
PY  - 2015
AB  - EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES As a result of reading this article, physicians should be able to: 1. Describe the concept of bundled payments and the potential applications of bundled payments in orthopedic surgery. 2. For specific situations, outline a clinical episode of care, determine the participants in a bundling situation, and define care protocols and pathways. 3. Recognize the importance of resource utilization management, quality outcome measurement, and combined economic-clinical value in determining the value of bundled payment arrangements. 4. Identify the implications of bundled payments for practicing orthopedists, as well as the legal issues and potential future directions of this increasingly popular alternative payment method. Bundled payments, the idea of paying a single price for a bundle of goods and services, is a financial concept familiar to most American consumers because examples appear in many industries. The idea of bundled payments has recently gained significant momentum as a financial model with the potential to decrease the significant current costs of health care. Orthopedic surgery as a field of medicine is uniquely positioned for success in an environment of bundled payments. This article reviews the history, logistics, and implications of the bundled payment model relative to orthopedic surgery.

TI  - Posterior wall blowout on computed tomography after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">During anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, even when a posterior wall of the femoral bone tunnel is identified, computed tomography (CT) occasionally demonstrates a breach of the posterior femoral cortex of the femoral bone tunnel, i.e., posterior wall blowout, after ACL reconstruction (posterior wall blowout-like phenomenon). This study aimed to investigate the influence of the posterior wall blowout-like phenomenon on clinical outcomes after ACL reconstruction using hamstring tendon.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A total of 105 patients who underwent CT examination two weeks after ACL reconstruction were enrolled. A cortical suspension device was used for femoral side fixation in all cases. Posterior wall was identified in all cases during the surgery. The side-to-side difference in anterior knee laxity, pivot shift test, Lysholm knee score, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective form, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were evaluated one year after the surgery. A second CT examination was performed 6-12 months after the surgery, if a posterior wall blowout-like phenomenon was identified in the first CT examination.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Two weeks after the surgery, 16 of the 105 patients showed a posterior wall blowout-like phenomenon. Twelve of the 16 cases demonstrated a regenerated posterior femoral cortex of the femoral bone tunnel on their second CT images. There were no significant differences between the posterior wall blowout-like phenomenon group and the normal posterior wall group in terms of a side-to-side difference in anterior knee laxity (0.4 ± 1.5 mm and 0.1 ± 1.6 mm, respectively), pivot shift test, Lysholm knee score, IKDC score, and KOOS at one year after surgery. The length and diameter of the femoral bone tunnel were not significantly different between the two groups.</AbstractText>

TI  - Human knee laxity in ACL-deficient and physiological contralateral joints: intra-operative measurements using a navigation system
PY  - 2014
AB  - The comprehension of human knee laxity and of the failures of relevant surgical reconstructions of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) can be enhanced by the knowledge of the laximetric status of the contralateral healthy knee (CHK). Rarely this is available in patients, directly from the skeletal structures, and for a number of the standard clinical tests. The general aim of this study was to measure the extent to which laxity occurs immediately before surgery in the ACL deficient knee (ADK) with respect to CHK, in a number of standard clinical evaluation tests. Thirty-two patients with ACL deficiency were analyzed at ADK and at CHK by a navigation system immediately before reconstructions. Knee laxity was assessed based on digitized anatomical references during the antero-posterior drawer, Lachman, internal-external rotation, varus-valgus, and pivot-shift tests. Antero-posterior laxity was normalized based on patient-specific length of the tibial plateau. In the drawer test, statistical significance (p < 0.05) was found for the larger antero-posterior laxity in ADK than in CHK, on average, of 54' in the medial and 47' in the lateral compartments, when measured in normalized translations. In the Lachman test, these were about 106' and 68'. The pivot-shift test revealed a significant 70' larger antero-posterior central laxity and a 32' larger rotational laxity. No statistically relevant differences were observed in the other tests. The first conclusion is that it is important to measure also the antero-posterior and rotational laxity of the uninjured contralateral knee in assessing the laxity of the injured knee. A second is that the Lachman test shows knee laxity better than the AP drawer, and that the pivot-shift test was the only one able to reveal rotational instability. The present original measurements and analyses contribute to the knowledge of knee joint mechanics, with possible relevant applications in biomedical and clinical research.

TI  - Physical Examinations and Device Measurements for ACL Deficiency
PY  - 2016
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most common knee traumas, particularly during sport activities. “Giving way” is a subjective symptom of the knee with ACL insufficiency. A number of clinical tests for ACL laxity have been proposed since it was first described by Stark in 1850. To quantitatively evaluate knee laxity, several knee ligament measurement devices have been also developed. The results of the manual tests and quantitative measurement are described in a grading system for further clinical evaluations, most commonly using the IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) evaluation form. Recently the importance of pivot-shift test as a detector of a dynamic rotational instability has been reported. In recent years, with new technologies, dynamic three-dimensional knee instability measurement devices also have been developed.

TI  - Correction to: Arthroscopic primary repair of proximal anterior cruciate ligament tears seems safe but higher level of evidence is needed: a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent literature.
PY  - 2019
AB  - To assess the outcomes of the various techniques of primary repair of proximal anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears in the recent literature using a systematic review with meta-analysis. PRISMA guidelines were followed. All studies reporting outcomes of arthroscopic primary repair of proximal ACL tears using primary repair, repair with static (suture) augmentation and dynamic augmentation between January 2014 and July 2019 in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane were identified and included. Primary outcomes were failure rates and reoperation rates, and secondary outcomes were patient-reported outcome scores. A total of 13 studies and 1,101 patients (mean age 31 years, mean follow-up 2.1 years, 60% male) were included. Nearly all studies were retrospective studies without a control group and only one randomized study was identified. Grade of recommendation for primary repair was weak. There were 9 out of 74 failures following primary repair (10%), 6 out of 69 following repair with static augmentation (7%) and 106 out of 958 following dynamic augmentation (11%). Repair with dynamic augmentation had more reoperations (99; 10%), and more hardware removal (255; 29%) compared to the other procedures. All functional outcome scores were > 85% of maximum scores. This systematic review with meta-analysis found that the different techniques of primary repair are safe with failure rates of 7–11%, no complications and functional outcome scores of > 85% of maximum scores. There was a high risk of bias and follow-up was short with 2.1 years. Prospective studies comparing the outcomes to ACL reconstruction with sufficient follow-up are needed prior to widespread implementation. IV.

TI  - Tibial tunnel enlargement following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate changes in the tibial bone tunnel following endoscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft. We used computed tomography (CT) sequentially to monitor the time course of these changes over a 2-year period and correlated the results to clinical outcome and instrumented laxity measurements. Type of Study: Case series. Methods: Thirty-four patients (11 women, 23 men; mean age, 26.4 ± 4.5 years) who underwent endoscopic patellar tendon ACL reconstruction, were evaluated clinically according to IKDC, Lysholm, and Tegner scores as well as with respect to changes in tibial tunnel morphology over a 2-year period. Subsequent CT scans were performed at 1 and 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. The tibial bone tunnel was measured in the sagittal and coronal planes at 5 different levels (L1 to L5). Results: The diameters of the tibial tunnel increased an average overall by 30.6% in the sagittal plane and 16.4% in the coronal plane within 2 years. The enlargement was significantly higher ( P P Conclusions: Endoscopic ACL reconstruction is associated with tibial tunnel enlargement, which is already present within weeks following surgery. However, no negative effects on the clinical results were found over a 24-month period in our study population.

PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract Piva SR, Fitzgerald GK, Irrgang JJ, Fritz JM, Wisniewski S, McGinty GT, Childs JD, Domenech MA, Jones S, Delitto A. Associates of physical function and pain in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. Objectives To explore whether impairment of muscle strength, soft tissue length, movement control, postural and biomechanic alterations, and psychologic factors are associated with physical function and pain in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Rehabilitation outpatient. Participants Seventy-four patients diagnosed with PFPS. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Measurements were self-reported function and pain; strength of quadriceps, hip abduction, and hip external rotation; length of hamstrings, quadriceps, plantar flexors, iliotibial band/tensor fasciae latae complex, and lateral retinaculum; foot pronation; Q-angle; tibial torsion; visual observation of quality of movement during a lateral step-down task; anxiety; and fear-avoidance beliefs. Results After controlling for age and sex, anxiety and fear-avoidance beliefs about work and physical activity were associated with function, while only fear-avoidance beliefs about work and physical activity were associated with pain. Conclusions Psychologic factors were the only associates of function and pain in patients with PFPS. Factors related to physical impairments did not associate to function or pain. Our results should be validated in other samples of patients with PFPS. Further studies should determine the role of other psychologic factors, and how they relate to anxiety and fear-avoidance beliefs in these patients.

TI  - Can Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predict Posterior Drawer Laxity at the Time of Surgery in Patients With Knee Dislocation or Multiple-Ligament Knee Injury?
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: Previous studies indicate that isolated posterior cruciate ligament injuries demonstrate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical evidence of healing when treated nonoperatively; however, the authors are unaware of any other study that has looked at whether initial MRI can predict posterior cruciate ligament stability at the time of surgery in patients with knee dislocation.Hypothesis: An MRI grading system will predict laxity on posterior drawer testing at the time of surgery in patients with knee dislocations.Study Design: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2.Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients with knee dislocation or multiple-ligament knee injury evaluated by MRI were included in the study. An assignment of grade 0 (intact), grade I (injured/fibers intact), grade II (partial tearing of ligament), or grade III (complete tear) was made after each reading on 2 separate occasions by 3 surgeons. Posterior laxity of the knee was graded by the magnitude of excursion on the post...

TI  - Patients Walking Faster After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Have More Gait Asymmetry.
PY  - 2021
AB  - # Background
Gait asymmetries after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) may lead to radiographic knee osteoarthritis. Slower walking speeds have been associated with biomarkers suggesting cartilage breakdown. The relationship between walking speed and gait symmetry after ACLR is unknown. 

# Hypothesis/Purpose
To determine the relationship between self-selected walking speeds and gait symmetry in athletes after primary, unilateral ACLR.

# Study Design
Secondary analysis of a clinical trial.

# Methods
Athletes 24±8 weeks after primary ACLR walked at self-selected speeds as kinematics, kinetics, and electromyography data were collected. An EMG-driven musculoskeletal model was used to calculate peak medial compartment contact force (pMCCF). Variables of interest were peak knee flexion moment (pKFM) and angle (pKFA), knee flexion and extension (KEE) excursions, peak knee adduction moment (pKAM), and pMCCF. Univariate correlations were run for walking speed and each variable in the ACLR knee, contralateral knee, and interlimb difference (ILD).

# Results
Weak to moderate positive correlations were observed for walking speed and all variables of interest in the contralateral knee (Pearson’s r=.301-.505, p≤0.01). In the ACLR knee, weak positive correlations were observed for only pKFM (r=.280, p=0.02) and pKFA (r=.263, p=0.03). Weak negative correlations were found for ILDs in pKFM (r=-0.248, p=0.04), KEE (r=-.260, p=0.03), pKAM (r=-.323, p<0.01), and pMCCF (r=-.286, p=0.02). 

# Conclusion
Those who walk faster after ACLR have more asymmetries, which are associated with the development of early OA. This data suggests that interventions that solely increase walking speed may accentuate gait symmetry in athletes early after ACLR. Gait-specific, unilateral, neuromuscular interventions for the ACLR knee may be needed to target gait asymmetries after ACLR.

TI  - Comparison of KD3-M and KD3-L Multiligamentous Knee Injuries and Analysis of Predictive Factors That Influence the Outcomes of Single-Stage Reconstruction in KD3 Injuries.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background The knee dislocation-3 (KD3) injury pattern is the most common form of multiligamentous injury. Medial KD3 (KD3-M) and lateral KD3 (KD3-L) are 2 anatomically different varieties of this injury. Purpose To compare the surgical outcomes of KD3-M and KD3-L multiligamentous knee injury patterns and to determine the factors that could influence the outcomes after single-stage reconstruction. Study design Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods A cohort of 45 patients with multiligamentous knee injuries (31 KD3-M, 14 KD3-L) who were operated on between 2011 and 2015 were compared. The cruciate ligaments were reconstructed, and the collateral ligaments were managed either conservatively or surgically depending on intraoperative laxity, tissue condition, injury site, and chronicity. The mean follow-up was 36 months (range, 24-72 months). The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, knee flexion range of motion (ROM), and laxity on stress radiographs were compared. Various factors likely to influence the outcomes were also analyzed. Results The mean IKDC score, Lysholm score, and knee flexion ROM for the 45 patients were 74.74, 87.66, and 126.78°, respectively. There was no significant difference between the KD3-M and KD3-L groups in terms of the postoperative IKDC score (P = .768), Lysholm score (P = .689), knee flexion ROM (P = .798), and laxity on stress radiographs (P = .011). Patients with a transient dislocation had better outcomes (76.51, 89.41, and 128.61°, respectively) than those with a frank dislocation (67.62, 80.66, and 119.44°) (P = .037, .007, and .043). The acute group had better outcomes (77.00, 89.51, and 127.86°) when compared with the subacute (66.26, 86.00, and 121.00°) and chronic groups (67.40, 76.40, and 125.00°) (P = .045, .006, and .486). Regression analysis showed the influence of these factors on outcomes. The presence or absence of dislocations, time frame in which surgery was performed, and follow-up duration were found to influence the outcome. All other factors had no bearing on outcomes. Two patients had knee stiffness and underwent arthrolysis. Conclusion Despite anatomic and biomechanical differences between KD3-M and KD3-L injuries, single-stage management did not produce any significant difference in results. The presence of a frank dislocation, delay in surgery, and duration of follow-up were found to influence outcomes.

TI  - Rehabilitation Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears in Children: A Systematic Review.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are increasingly prevalent in the pediatric population. ACL rehabilitation is an essential component of recovery following injury and reconstruction, yet there are few explicit descriptions of pediatric-specific ACL rehabilitation protocols in the literature, especially in the context of varying treatment interventions. Our aim was to systematically review the literature on rehabilitation following ACL tears in children in order to describe common principles among different treatment options and areas of future research.

Methods: Using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we performed a systematic review of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases (for the past five years) to identify detailed rehabilitation protocols described in the pediatric population following ACL rupture. When available, the following aspects of rehabilitation were extracted: “prehabilitation” (exercises prior to surgery), bracing, weight-bearing status, range of motion, strength, modalities (ice, heat, electrical stimulation, etc.), plyometrics/proprioceptive exercises, return-to-sport criteria, and suggested ACL injury-prevention programs.

Results: Two hundred and two unique articles were identified. Twenty-seven articles meeting inclusion criteria with extractible rehabilitation data were included. A table, categorized by differing orthopaedic intervention, was designed to detail the components and duration of the different aspects of rehabilitation. While there are substantial differences across protocols, several trends emerged, particularly regarding weight-bearing, bracing, range of motion, and strength training. Interestingly, we found that many current protocols are based on time frame alone rather than on functional milestones; of the fourteen unique articles that addressed return-to-sport criteria by specific orthopaedic intervention, seven were based on temporal progression whereas seven also involved achievement of physical milestones. In addition, only three of the eight articles that mentioned a future ACL injury-prevention plan described a formal prevention program.

Conclusion: We systematically identified, and subsequently outlined and compared, the current trends of the various components of pediatric-specific ACL rehabilitation protocols, categorized by orthopaedic intervention. Several protocols are based on time frames rather than milestones achieved, with newer protocols involving milestone-based progression. Newer protocols are also incorporating formal prevention programs. Just as skeletally immature patients require unique methods of operative fixation, so too do they require catered rehabilitation protocols. To effectively prevent re-rupture or contralateral injury, future research should focus on prospectively evaluating each component of the rehabilitation protocols described and return-to-sport criteria for young patients.

TI  - Rehabilitation training using a single-joint type hybrid assistive limb for the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: an initial case report indicating safety and feasibility.
PY  - 2021
AB  - [Purpose] The aim of this report was to describe the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of rehabilitation by knee extension and flexion training using the knee single-joint hybrid assistive limb in a patient after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. [Participant and Methods] A 33 year-old male underwent an arthroscopic procedure for anatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a semitendinosus tendon autograft. Rehabilitation training using the knee single-joint hybrid assistive limb was initiated at postoperative week 18 and repeated weekly for 3 weeks. The patient performed five sets of the knee single-joint hybrid assistive limb-assisted knee-extension-flexion exercises per session at a frequency of 10 exercises/set. [Results] The peak extension torque at all velocities with the limb symmetry index was higher after the hybrid assistive limb intervention (post-intervention) than before using it (pre-intervention). Peak flexion torques at 60°/s and 300°/s of limb symmetry index were higher post-intervention than pre-intervention. The range of motion in extension and flexion improved from -2° (pre-intervention) to -1° (post-intervention) and from 124° to 133°, respectively. The Lysholm score increased from 58 (pre-intervention) to 94 (post-intervention). [Conclusion] The knee single-joint hybrid assistive limb can be used safely for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction training, without any adverse events. Our results indicate that the knee single-joint hybrid assistive limb training may improve muscle function, effectively overcoming dysfunction.

TI  - Which Metrics Are Being Used to Evaluate Children and Adolescents After ACL Reconstruction? A Systematic Review.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose To identify a comprehensive list of outcome measures previously used in the literature to evaluate clinical outcomes after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in patients 18 years of age or younger. Methods A literature search was performed by querying MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane computerized databases for relevant articles that reported clinical outcomes in pediatric patients undergoing ACL reconstruction. Studies that were nonclinical, that reported on patients older than 19 years, that were not available in English, or that included fewer than 10 patients were excluded. Outcome measures of all eligible studies were recorded. Results We identified 77 studies published between 1986 and 2018 in 20 peer-reviewed journals. The mean age of the patients was 13.9 years. The ACL rerupture rate was reported in 60% of studies; 32 studies (42%) reported a rate of return to preinjury activity or sports. The use of adult-validated patient-reported outcome measures were reported in 63 (82%) articles. The Lysholm (64%), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) (56%) and Tegner (37%) scores were the most commonly reported. Two patient-reported outcome measures designed for pediatric patients (the Pedi-IKDC and Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (Pedi-FABS) were employed in 5 (6%) recent studies. Conclusions There is variability across studies in the metrics used to assess clinical outcomes following ACL reconstruction in children and adolescents. Validated pediatric-specific instruments were used infrequently. Clinical Relevance A large body of existing pediatric ACL-reconstruction literature relies on a variable set of outcome measures that have not been developed or validated for children and adolescents. More recently, contemporary studies have begun to employ pediatric- and adolescent-specific validated measures, yet their use remains uncommon.

TI  - Meniscal Suturing Versus Screw Fixation for Treatment of Osteochondritis Dissecans: Clinical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Results
PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare meniscal stabilization alone with screw fixation in restoring subjective and objective knee function and structural cartilage integrity in skeletally immature patients with osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee. Methods This study comprised 28 patients (32 knees) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–confirmed OCD. Unstable menisci were treated with either stabilization (15 patients, 16 knees) or screw fixation (13 patients, 16 knees; control group). Patients were assessed by functional scoring (Hughston, International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC]) and MRI for a minimum follow-up period of 2.5 years. Results In the meniscus stabilization group, the Hughston score improved from 1.4 to 3.8 ( P P P P Conclusions Meniscal suturing alone for the treatment of an OCD of the knee shows good or excellent results in terms of clinical scoring and MRI assessment at almost 3 years' follow-up. The results are comparable with those of screw fixation but with a faster recovery in the postoperative course. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative study.

TI  - Allograft anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in patients over 40 years of age.
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract Purpose: The study goal was to determine the results of allograft anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in patients over 40 years old at a minimum of 24 months follow-up (mean, 59.7 months; range, 24 to 110 months). Type of Study: Retrospective review. Methods: The records of 57 consecutive patients (mean age at surgery, 45.0 years; range, 40.2 to 60.8 years) were reviewed retrospectively. Nine patients who had undergone either prior ACL reconstruction, extra-articular reinforcement of the intra-articular procedure, or subsequent upper tibial osteotomy were eliminated. One patient was lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 47 patients (48 knees), 29 (62%) were men, and 18 (38%) were women. Twenty-eight of the 47 study patients (60%) were available for clinical interview consisting of physical examination, radiographs, and functional testing. Twenty-seven of these patients also underwent KT-1000 measurement, and 26 underwent Biodex evaluation. The remaining 19 patients were interviewed by telephone. Results: At follow-up, Lachman, anterior drawer, and pivot shift tests were 0 or 1 in 27 (96%) of 28 patients. Differences between the index and contralateral legs as measured by KT-1000 at 20 lb of force were 0 to 2 mm in 22 of 27 patients (81%) and 3 to 5.5 mm in 5 patients (19%). None had a side-to-side difference greater than 5.5 mm. Based on the International Knee Documentation Committee activity classification system, 26 (55%) of 47 patients achieved the same or higher grade of activity postoperatively as they had preinjury. Conclusions: Results of ACL reconstruction in patients over 40 compare favorably with those observed in younger patients. Age should not be a limiting factor in choosing surgical reconstruction to treat functional instability in the ACL-deficient patient.

TI  - Joint effusion, anteroposterior stability, muscle strength and degree of patellofemoral osteoarthritis significantly impact outcome following revision ACL reconstruction.
PY  - 2021
AB  - PURPOSE Effusion, impaired muscle function and knee instability are considered as some of the most important factors effecting outcome following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) but the impact on revision ACL-R remains unclear. It was hypothesized that these factors will significantly worsen clinical outcome following revision ACL-R. METHODS Seventy knees (13 female and 57 male) were followed retrospectively after revision ACL-R at a mean follow-up of 47.8 ± 20.7 months. Clinical examination was based on the International Knee Documentation Evaluation Form-2000 (IKDC), Tegner activity scale. Instrumented measurement of anterior tibial translation was performed using the Rolimeter® (DJO Global, Freiburg, Germany). Bilateral circumference of the thigh was measured 10 and 20 cm proximal to the medial joint space. Cartilage was assessed according to Outerbridge classification during both primary and revision ACL-R. RESULTS Tegner activity scale decreased significantly from 7.8 ± 1.4 points at primary ACL-R to 7 ± 1.8 points at revision ACL-R, and 5.8 ± 1.7 points at the time of follow up (p  grad 2 was responsible for IKDC grade C and D (p = 0.035). Instrumented anteroposterior site-to-site difference of ≥3 mm showed significant impact on clinical outcome (p < 0.019). CONCLUSION The study has shown that chronic effusion, quadriceps dysfunction, cartilage lesions especially at the patellofemoral compartment and side to side difference in anteroposterior stability significantly influences patient outcome after revision ACL-R. These factors require special attention when predicting patient's outcome. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level-IV, case-controlled study.

TI  - Combined ACLR and lateral extra-articular tenodesis with a continuous iliotibial band autograft is a viable option in a population of athletes who participate in pivoting sports.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical results, return to sport and complications after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) associated with lateral extra-articular tenodesis using continuous plasty with an iliotibial band.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This was a prospective multicentre study involving 186 patients who had surgery for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Patients with multiligament ruptures and revision surgery were excluded from the study. All patients included were involved in pivoting sports and wished to resume their activity after surgery. Patients were assessed at a minimum 2-year follow-up using functional and psychological questionnaires (subjective International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC], Tegner, Lysholm and ACL-RSI scores), ligament assessment including instrumented laxity measurement (Rolimeter), Lachman test and pivot shift and isokinetic testing. Return to sport was assessed using a questionnaire, and complications and repeat surgeries were recorded.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">At a mean follow-up of 43.1 months, the subjective IKDC, Lysholm, ACL-RSI and objective IKDC scores were significantly improved (59.8 vs. 94.5 p &lt; 0.0001, 75 vs. 99 p &lt; 0.0001, 60 vs. 93 p &lt; 0.0001, IKDC A 0% vs. 72%, B 12% vs. 27%, C 60% vs. 1% D 28% vs. 0% p &lt; 0.0001). The Tegner activity level was 9 (3-10) before the accident and 9 (3-10) at the last review. Seventy-six percent of the patients had returned to sports at the same level. The differential laxity was 6.6 mm (±1.7) preoperatively and 1.1 mm (±1.4) postoperatively. Additionally, 97% were equal in pivot shift at the last follow-up. At the 6-month isokinetic assessment, the muscle strength recovery for the quadriceps and hamstring was over 85% compared with the healthy side for 79% and 70% of the patients, respectively. Ten patients had graft rupture (5.6%). Four (2.4%) patients had a contralateral ACL rupture, and seven (4%) underwent a reoperation with meniscectomy.</AbstractText>

TI  - A Comparative Study on Outcomes of Partial Meniscectomy for Horizontal Cleavage Tear of Medial Meniscus: Complete versus Partial Resection of Inferior Leaf.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The extent to which resection of unstable leaf should be performed in horizontal cleavage meniscus tear has not yet been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of partial meniscectomy for horizontal cleavage tear of medial meniscus between complete resection of inferior leaf including the periphery up to the joint capsule and partial resection leaving stable peripheral torn meniscal tissue. A total of 126 patients who underwent partial meniscectomy for horizontal cleavage tear of medial meniscus were divided into two groups: group C (<i>n</i> = 34), treated with the complete resection of the inferior leaf; and group P (<i>n</i> = 92), treated with partial resection of the inferior leaf. The minimum follow-up duration was 3 years. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Lysholm knee scoring scale, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation form, and knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS). Radiologic assessments were performed using the IKDC radiographic assessment scale and measurement of the height of the joint space in the medial compartment of the tibiofemoral joint. The functional outcomes including the Lysholm knee, IKDC subjective score, activities of daily living and sport and recreation subscale of KOOS were worse in group C than in group P (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The radiologic outcomes including postoperative IKDC radiographic scale (<i>p</i> = 0.003) and the postoperative joint space on the affected side (<i>p</i> < 0.001) were also worse in group C than in group P. In the horizontal cleavage tear of medial meniscus, complete resection of the inferior leaf including the periphery up to the joint capsule showed inferior clinical outcomes compared with partial resection leaving stable peripheral rim of torn meniscus at minimum 3-year follow-up. If the peripheral part of the inferior leaf is stable in horizontal cleavage tear of medial meniscus, partial resection of the inferior leaf preserving peripheral rim can be recommended.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging of the patellar tendon after harvesting its central third: a comparison between traditional and subcutaneous harvesting techniques.
PY  - 1999
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the 2-year results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autografts harvested through a paratenon-splitting, traditional technique (group A) with the results of a subcutaneous technique aiming at protecting the infrapatellar nerves and the paratenon (group B). Special emphasis was placed on evaluating the donor site. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patellar tendon was performed to evaluate the reconstitution after harvesting its central third. Examinations of knee-walking ability and assessments of anterior knee sensitivity were made in order to evaluate donor-site discomfort and the function of infrapatellar nerves. Seventy-two consecutive patients were included in the study; group A comprised 35 patients and group B, 37 patients. At the 2-year follow-up, the Tegner activity level, the Lysholm score, and the IKDC evaluation system showed no significant differences between groups A and B. The median loss of normal anterior knee sensitivity was 16 cm2 (range, 0 to 200 cm2) in group A and 0 cm2 (range, 0 to 285 cm2) in group B (P = .20). In group A 20% of the patients and in group B 58% had normal sensitivity (P < .01). MRI showed that the donor-site gap (area corresponding to non-tendinous-like tissue signal) was 5 mm (range, 0 to 9 mm) in group A and 2 mm (range, 0 to 5 mm) in group B (P < .0001). At 2-year follow-up, the subcutaneous graft-harvesting technique resulted in less disturbance of anterior knee sensitivity and a smaller donor-site gap than the traditional technique.

TI  - Comparing Hamstring Autograft With Hybrid Graft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose To systematically review the literature in an effort to compare the demographics and clinical outcomes of patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with a hamstring tendon autograft (HT) versus an irradiated or nonirradiated hybrid autograft-allograft. Methods A systematic review of the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. All English-language literature that reported general demographics and compared the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing primary ACLR with autograft versus hybrid graft (HG) with a minimum 2-year follow-up was reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Search terms used were “anterior cruciate ligament” and “hybrid graft.” Patients were assessed based on graft failure, anteroposterior laxity, and patient-reported outcomes (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, visual analog scale, Subjective International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm, and Tegner scores). Study quality was evaluated with the Modified Coleman Methodology Score and ROBINS-I risk of bias tool. Results Twelve studies (1 level II, 11 level III) met inclusion criteria (follow-up, 2.0-8.9 years), including 471 patients undergoing ACLR with an irradiated hybrid graft (IH), 89 patients with a nonirradiated hybrid graft, and 829 patients with HT. Graft diameter ranged from 7.5 to 10.0 mm and from 6.5 to 10.0 mm in HG and HT patients, respectively. Overall, graft failure ranged from 0% to 30.0% and from 0% to 28.3% in HG and HT patients, respectively (I2 = 35.9%; 95% confidence interval 0%-74.8%). Among HG patients, graft failure ranged from 0%-30.0% and from 2.4%-4.2% in IH and nonirradiated hybrid graft groups, respectively (I2 = 33.6%; 95% confidence interval, 0%-71.8%). Results for postoperative anteroposterior laxity and patient-reported outcomes were also inconsistent. Conclusions Patients undergoing ACLR with HT demonstrate inconsistent differences in clinical outcomes at midterm follow-up compared with IH patients. Level of Evidence III, systematic review of level II and III studies.

TI  - Development and Validation of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form
PY  - 2001
AB  - A committee of international knee experts created the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form, which is a knee-specific, rather than a disease-specific, measure of symptoms, function, and sports activity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the new International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form. To provide evidence for reliability and validity, we administered the final version of the form, along with the Short Form-36, to 533 patients with a variety of knee problems. Analyses were performed to determine reliability, validity, and differential item function related to age, sex, and diagnosis. Factor analysis revealed a single dominant component, making it reasonable to combine all questions into a single score. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were 0.92 and 0.95, respectively. Based on test-retest reliability, the value for a true change in the score was 9.0 points. The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form score was related to concurrent measures of physical function (r = 0.47 to 0.66) but not to emotional function (r = 0.16 to 0.26). Analysis of differential item function indicated that the questions functioned similarly for men versus women, young versus old, and for those with different diagnoses. In conclusion, the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form is a reliable and valid knee-specific measure of symptoms, function, and sports activity that is appropriate for patients with a wide variety of knee problems. Use of this instrument will permit comparisons of outcome across groups with different knee problems.

TI  - Influence of knee position and examiner-induced motion on the kinematics of the pivot shift
PY  - 2019
AB  - Grading of the pivot shift test varies significantly depending on the examiner’s technique. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the influence of knee starting position and the magnitude of motion during the reduction event on the magnitude of the pivot shift test. Twenty-five clinical providers each performed a total of twenty pivot shift tests on one of two fresh-frozen cadaveric full lower extremity specimens with different grades of rotatory knee laxity. By means of ACL transection and lateral meniscectomy, one specimen was prepared to have a high-grade pivot shift and one to have a low-grade pivot shift. Six-degree-of-freedom kinematics were recorded during each pivot shift test using an electromagnetic-tracking-system. Successful pivot shift tests were defined and selected using an automated, mathematical algorithm based on the exceeding of a threshold value of anterior translation of the lateral knee compartment. The kinematics were correlated with the magnitude of anterior translation of the lateral knee compartment based on varying degrees of rotatory knee laxity using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Only mild correlations between anterior translation of the lateral knee compartment and internal tibial rotation at the start of the reduction event were observed in both specimens. The ability to generate a successful reduction event was significantly dependent on the rotatory knee laxity, with a 54% success rate on the high-laxity specimen compared to a 30% success rate on the low-laxity specimen (p < 0.001). Nearly 80% of the variability of the anterior translation of the lateral knee compartment in both specimens was accounted for by external rotation during the reduction event (r = 0.847; p < 0.001). Varus rotation during the reduction event also showed a strong correlation with the anterior translation of the lateral knee compartment in the low-laxity specimen (r = 0.835; p < 0.001). Magnitude of motion during the reduction event affected the magnitude of anterior translation of the lateral knee compartment more than the starting position. External rotation during the reduction event accounted for most of the variability in the pivot shift test. More uniform maneuvers and improved teaching are essential to generate repeatable quantitative results of the pivot shift test.

TI  - Long-Term Results of ACL Reconstruction Using a Nonanatomic Double-Bundle Technique with Extra-Articular Reinforcement.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Extra-articular procedures for the improvement in rotational stability after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction have gained popularity in the last decade. This surgical gesture hoped to improve resistance to the high tensional forces affecting the ACL graft during cutting and pivoting movements of the lower extremity and eventually prevent ACL reconstruction failure. We performed this study to analyze the long-term results of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction using a nonanatomic double-bundle technique with an additional extra-articular augmentation. All the cases that underwent an ACL reconstruction using a nonanatomic double-bundle technique with an extra-articular reinforcement during the period between 1992 and 1997 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria for this study included a minimum follow-up of 10 years and age between 14 and 45 years at the time of the surgery. Forty patients were included in this series (34 males and 6 females). The mean Lysholm score after a minimum follow-up period of 10 years was 92.3 (standard deviation [SD], 9.4). The average preoperative Tegner score of the participants was 7.0 (SD, 1.1). This score decreased to 5.7 (SD, 1.2) at the end of follow-up. Follow-up X-rays were reviewed to assess the degenerative changes in the three knee compartments. Degenerative changes ≥ Kellgren–Lawrence grade 2 were observed in our six (15%) patients, all of them in the medial knee compartment. With these results, we conclude that double-bundle nonanatomic ACL reconstruction combined with an extra-articular reinforcement resembling the anterolateral ligament offers good overall long-term results, with relatively low rates of osteoarthritis.

          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Volleyball players (mean ± SD age, 18 ± 0.8 years) enrolled in 2006-2011 in a prospective cohort study were invited in 2020-2022 to a follow-up study. Participants rated their knee function with the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Patellar Tendon (VISA-P) score (baseline and follow-up) and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score (follow-up) and reported if jumper's knee had influenced their decision to retire from sport. Tendon thickness and structural changes were assessed with ultrasound (baseline) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (follow-up) of both patellar tendons.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">We included 138 of 143 former athletes (97%) 11.4 ± 1.6 years after their baseline examination. At baseline, 37 persons (52 knees) had developed jumper's knee. At follow-up, participants reported lower knee function scores in knees diagnosed with jumper's knee at baseline than healthy knees (VISA-P scores: jumper's knee, 81 [95% CI, 70-92]; healthy, 90 [95% CI, 86-94]; <i>P</i> &lt; .001; IKDC scores: jumper's knee, 82 [95% CI, 75-89]; healthy, 92 [95% CI, 91-95]; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Jumper's knee problems directly caused 7 of the 37 athletes (19%) with jumper's knee at baseline to retire from competitive volleyball. Of the 138 players included, 97 (70%) completed a bilateral MRI examination (194 knees). At follow-up, 38 of the 54 abnormal tendons (70%) had no structural changes (<i>P</i> &lt; .001 vs baseline) while 22 of the 140 normal tendons (16%) had developed structural changes. Clinical symptoms were not correlated with tendon structure at follow-up (VISA-P scores for normal tendons: 85 [95% CI, 73-87]; abnormal: 89 [95% CI, 85-92]; <i>P</i> = .48).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Jumper's knee is not a self-limiting condition; volleyball players who had developed jumper's knee during adolescence reported persistent reductions in knee function 11 years later, leading one-fifth to retire from competitive volleyball.

Based on the time between the injury and ACLR, they were divided into acute (≤6 months) and chronic (&gt;6 months) groups. The chronic group had three subgroups of ACLR times: 7-12, 13-24 and &gt;24 months. Complete recovery was defined as a change from grade B or C upon injury to grade A before surgery according to the Muramatsu MRI classification. The relationship between preoperative and postoperative Lachman grades and pivot shifting test results and the degree of ALL injury was evaluated.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">In the chronic group, 19/61 patients (31.1%) had preoperative grade A, and 4/61 patients (6.5%) had grade A at the time of injury. In the acute group, 22/29 patients with grades B and C (76%) had grade 3 preoperative pivot shifting. In the acute group, grades 1 and 2 were more common in patients with grades B and C (10/29, 35%) than grade A (0/10, 0.0%).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The improvement rate was 24.6% among patients who did not receive ACLR in the acute phase and underwent ACLR in the chronic phase. In the acute group, the degree of ALL damage was related to the pivot shift results. However, the results in the chronic phase were not associated with the degree of injury.</AbstractText>

TI  - Dynamic radiostereometry can objectively quantify the kinematic laxity patterns and rotation instability of the knee during a pivot-shift test.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The pivot-shift test is used to clinically assess knee instability in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesions; however, it has low interobserver reliability. Dynamic radiostereometry (dRSA) is a highly precise and noninvasive method for the objective evaluation of joint kinematics. The purpose of this study was to quantify precise knee kinematics during a pivot-shift test using dRSA imaging.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHOD" NlmCategory="METHODS">Eight human donor legs, including hemipelvises, were evaluated. Arthroscopic intervention was performed inducing ligament lesions in the ACL, and anterolateral ligament (ALL) section was performed as a capsular incision. The pivot-shift test was recorded with dRSA on knees with intact ligaments, ACL-deficient and ACL + ALL-deficient knees.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A pivot-shift pattern was identifiable after ligament lesion, as a change in tibial posterior drawer velocity from 7.8 mm/s (95% CI: 3.7; 11.9) in ligament intact knees to 30.4 mm/s (95% CI 23.0; 38.8) after ACL lesion to 35.1 mm/s (95% CI 23.4; 46.7) after combined ACL-ALL lesion. The anterior-posterior drawer excursion increased from 2.8 mm (95% CI 2.1; 3.4) in ligament intact knees to 7.2 mm (95% CI 5.5; 8.9) after ACL lesion to 7.6 mm (95% CI 5.5; 9.8) after combined lesion. A statistically significant increase in tibial external rotation towards the end of the pivot-shift motion was observed when progressing from intact to ACL + ALL-deficient knees (p &lt; 0.023).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">This experimental study demonstrates the feasibility of dRSA to objectively quantify the kinematic laxity patterns of the knee during the pivot-shift test. The dynamic parameters obtained through dRSA revealed the kinematic changes from ACL to combined ACL-ALL ligament lesion.</AbstractText>

TI  - TIMELINE OF GAINS IN QUADRICEPS STRENGTH SYMMETRY AND PATIENT-REPORTED FUNCTION EARLY AFTER ACL RECONSTRUCTION
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background Quadriceps weakness is a predictor of long-term knee function and strength recovery can vary from months to years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, few studies evaluate quadriceps strength and self-reported function within the first several weeks after ACLR. Hypothesis/Purpose To examine changes over time in quadriceps strength symmetry, quadriceps peak torque, and self-reported knee function prior to and at six, 12, and 24 weeks post-ACLR. The hypotheses were 1) quadriceps strength symmetry, bilateral quadriceps peak torque, and patient-reported function would improve over time from pre-ACLR to 24 weeks post-ACLR and 2) significant improvements in patient-reported function, but not strength symmetry, would occur between time points. Study Design Prospective, cohort study. Methods Thirty participants completed four testing sessions: pre-surgery and six, 12, and 24 weeks post-ACLR. Isometric quadriceps strength testing was performed at six weeks and isokinetic quadriceps strength was measured at all other testing points. Quadriceps index was calculated to evaluate between limb quadriceps strength symmetry. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC) were administered at each time point. A repeated-measures analysis of variance evaluated changes over time, with post-hoc comparisons to determine at which time-point significant changes occurred. Results Quadriceps strength symmetry, involved limb quadriceps peak torque and all patient-reported outcome scores increased over time (p<0.02). Post-hoc tests showed that neither self-reported outcomes, nor quadriceps index improved between pre-surgery and six-weeks post-ACLR. From six to 12 weeks post-ACLR, scores on IKDC and KOOS Pain, Symptoms, Quality of Life, and Sport subscales improved (p≤0.003). From 12 to 24 weeks post-ACLR, quadriceps strength symmetry, involved limb quadriceps peak torque, KOOS-Symptoms, Quality of Life, and Sport subscales and the IKDC improved (p≤0.01). Uninvolved limb quadriceps peak torque did not change across any time point (p≥0.18). Conclusion Patient-reported knee function increased between six and 24 weeks post-ACLR, while increases in involved limb quadriceps strength and quadriceps strength symmetry were not noted until 12-24 weeks post-ACLR. Level of Evidence 2b, individual cohort study.

TI  - Long-term follow-up after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a press-fit quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The use of a quadriceps tendon-patellar bone (QTPB) autograft provides an alternative procedure in primary reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Using the press-fit technique for femoral fixation and knotting over a bone bridge as well as additional spongiosa filling for tibial fixation can completely eliminate the need for fixation implants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical, functional and radiological results of this operating method. Sixty-nine patients (27 female-42 male) were included in this study. Fifty-seven patients (83%) received a comprehensive follow-up review after an average period of 7.5 years (range: 7–8.7). All other patients were surveyed by telephone. Six patients (9%) suffered a re-rupture of the ACL graft caused by a new related trauma and were therefore excluded from the statistical analysis. Of all patients, 98% were satisfied with the operation. Normal or almost normal results were recorded in the subjective IKDC scores form by 88% of the patients. The Lysholm score demonstrated very good and good results in 83% of the patients. Only 1 patient reported minor complaints in the donor area. Seven (12%) patients developed Cyclops syndrome with limited knee extension. This complication was treated arthroscopically within the first year postoperatively. Their results on follow-up were not worse than the results of the patients without Cyclops syndrome. Regarding the 57 patients who received a comprehensive evaluation, the stability test with the KT-1000 Arthrometer yielded a difference of less than 3 mm in the contralateral comparison for 89% of the operated knees. The pivot-shift test was normal in 79% and almost normal in 21%. In the Single-leg Triple Hop Test, patients achieved an average of 98% of the hopping distance attained with the contralateral leg. The radiological examination revealed a slight deterioration in the Kellgren-Lawrence Score in 2 patients. The ACL reconstruction using the QTPB autograft performed with the press-fit technique leads to good results in comparison with published results of established procedures for primary ACL surgery using other autografts. Further investigations should involve comparative studies with the objective of providing evidence-based, individually adapted therapy for ACL rupture.

TI  - Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bioabsorbable polyglycolic acid interference screws: MR imaging follow-up.
PY  - 2002
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging the degradation of an interference screw made of polyglycolic acid (67.5%) and trimethylene carbonate (32.5%) and compare the MR findings with the clinical evaluation results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and MR imaging studies were performed concomitantly 6 months (in 20 patients), 1 year (in 10 patients), and 2 years (in eight patients) after surgery. Screw resorption rate, tibial tunnel appearance and contents, epiphyseal reaction, reconstructed ligament appearance, bone plug healing, joint effusion, and synovitis were evaluated. RESULTS: The screw was observed to be partially resorbed (by approximately one-third) at 6 months and totally resorbed at 1 year. Enhancement of the tunnel content, which can be linked to bone healing and screw replacement, was seen without a surrounding inflammatory reaction. Bone tunnel enlargement was observed and remained stable over time; this phenomenon has often been reported with metallic or polylactic acid inte...

TI  - A new generation of artificial ligaments in reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Two-year follow-up of a randomised trial.
PY  - 2002
AB  - We have undertaken a randomised clinical trial comparing two methods of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in patients with chronic instability. We used an ipsilateral bone-patellar-tendon-bone autograft in 27 patients and the Ligament Advancement Reinforcement System (LARS) artificial ligament in 26. Assessment before and at two, six, 12 and 24 months after surgery, included the history, physical examination, a modified International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, the Tegner score, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and instrumented laxity testing. There were no cases of reactive synovitis or of infection of the knee, and there was no difference regarding the failure rate between the two groups. The IKDC showed no significant differences between the two groups at any stage of the follow-up. The KOOS evaluation showed consistently better results in all subscales for the LARS group during the first year of follow-up. After 24 months these differences were no longer evident. Instrument-tested laxity was greater in the LARS group at all stages of follow-up, but the differences were not significant at 24 months. Our findings suggest that at follow-up at 24 months the LARS ligament seems to be a satisfactory treatment option, especially when an early return to high levels of activity is demanded.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of a minimally invasive isolated medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction technique without considering bone anatomical factors in patients with patellar instability
PY  - 2024
AB  - <title>Abstract</title>
        <p><bold>Objective: </bold>The aim of this study was to demonstrate the clinical results of a minimally invasive anatomic reconstruction technique for isolated MPFL in cases of recurrent patellar instability, without consideration of Patella alta, TT-TG distance, and trochlear dysplasia.
<bold>Methods: </bold>Retrospective analysis was conducted on prospectively collected data from patients who underwent minimally invasive isolated MPFL reconstructive surgery at Norinco General Hospital between 2014 and 2019. Preoperative evaluation included assessment of the J-sign, trochlear dysplasia according to Dejour classification, patellar height using the Caton-Deschamps index (CDI), and tibial tubercle–trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance. Postoperatively, Kujala score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner score were assessed. Complications such as re-dislocation of the patella, patellar fracture, hematoma formation, and knee stiffness were recorded as failure if they severely affected knee function after MPFL reconstruction.
<bold>Results:</bold> A total of 106 patients (Average age, 21.5 ±5.9 years; 68% females; mean follow-up, 7.2±1.6 years) were included. 28 individuals (26%) presented with a preoperative positive J-sign, trochlear dysplasia was observed in 102 cases (A,48%; B,22%; C,18%; D,8%). The mean CDI value was 1.18±0.16 (range,0.9-1.5); average TT-TG distance, 21.0±3.8 mm (range,10-26 mm). The final follow-up mean Kujala score was 83.2 ± 14.6 (range 40-100); mean IKDC score, 77.8 ± 12.6 (range 24 - 93); mean Tegner score, 4.0 ± 1.8 (range 1-9). Postoperative patellar instability and re-dislocation were observed in 5 patients (5%). Knee pain emerged as the most prevalent postoperative complication (17%). Joint release surgery was required for two patients experiencing postoperative knee stiffness. The Kujala score of 70 patients was ≥80, and the clinical excellent rate reached 66%. Patients with positive J-sign and severe trochlear dysplasia before surgery are more likely to have unsatisfactory results（Kujala score＜80）, and both have significant differences. However, the two anatomical factors, CDI and TT-TG value, had no statistical significance on the satisfied and unsatisfied results of Kujala scores.
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> The reconstruction of the isolated medial patellofemoral ligament has shown positive clinical results in treating patellar instability. Especially for young female patients, a minimally invasive MPFL reconstruction technique with minimal scarring leads to increased patient satisfaction. However, in cases where preoperative assessment shows a positive J-Sign and severe trochlear dysplasia, it may be necessary to consider incorporating bony procedures such as tibial tubercle osteotomy or trochleoplasty.</p>

TI  - Comparison Between Continuous and Separate Grafts for ALL Reconstruction When Combined With ACL Reconstruction: A Retrospective Cohort Study From the SANTI Study Group.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">While various techniques have been described to augment the anterolateral side of the knee, such as lateral extra-articular tenodesis and anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction (ALLR), it is unclear how they affect clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the results of 2 ALLR techniques for combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)/ALL reconstruction.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="HYPOTHESIS">The graft rupture rate, complications, and patient-reported outcomes are similar between a reconstruction technique using a continuous gracilis graft (CG) and single femoral tunnel for ACL/ALL reconstruction, and one using a separate gracilis graft (SG) and independent femoral tunnels.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">A retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively at 2 hospitals was conducted: one in which a CG is preferred when performing combined ACL/ALL reconstruction and the other in which an SG is preferred. The medical records at these 2 hospitals were searched to identify ACL-deficient patients who had undergone ACL/ALL reconstruction between 2015 and 2020. Eligible patients were between 18 and 60 years of age, had the reconstruction surgery done within 24 months of the injury, and had ≥2 years of follow-up. The eligible patients were contacted to gather outcomes, or their outcomes were collected in person during their last follow-up visit. Outcomes evaluated included graft rupture rate, complication rate, and Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) scores. Preoperative and intraoperative data were also evaluated.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">A total of 237 patients were available for analysis in the GC group and 178 in the SG group with a mean follow-up of 3 years (CG: SD, 9.6 months; SG: SD, 8.1 months). The authors found a low rate of graft rupture (CG: 3.4%; SG: 2.8%; <i>P</i> = .785) and no difference between techniques. The complication rate was 6% in the CG group, while it was 10% in the SG group (<i>P</i> = .112). The mean value of the IKDC-SKF was similar between techniques (CG: 88.1; SG: 87.9; <i>P</i> = .267), and the mean Lysholm score was excellent in both sets of patients (CG: 90.0; SG: 92.4; <i>P</i> &lt; .001).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">This study found little to no difference in the graft rupture rate, complication rate, and functional knee scores when using a CG or SG for ALLR during combined ACL/ALL reconstruction. Both techniques are equivalent and can be used for an anterolateral augmentation procedure in combination with ACL reconstruction.</AbstractText>

TI  - Comparison of IKDC and SANE Outcome Measures Following Knee Injury in Active Female Patients
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background:Knee injury among young, active female patients remains a public health issue. Clinicians are called upon to pay greater attention to patient-oriented outcomes to evaluate the impact of these injuries. Little agreement exists on which outcome measures are best, and clinicians cite several barriers to their use. Single Assessment Numerical Evaluation (SANE) may provide meaningful outcome information while lessening the time burden associated with other patient-oriented measures.Hypothesis:The SANE and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores would be strongly correlated in a cohort of young active female patients with knee injuries from preinjury through 1-year follow-up and that a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) could be calculated for the SANE score.Study Design:Observational prospective cohort.Methods:Two hundred sixty-three subjects completed SANE and IKDC at preinjury by recall, time of injury, and 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury.

We examined whether a deficit of voluntary activation (VA) of the quadriceps muscle can be reversed by reconstruction of the ACL and assessed its influence on muscle strength and clinical parameters. We evaluated 12 male subjects with an isolated tear of the ACL and 12 matched control subjects before operation and two years after reconstruction of the ACL. Assessment included measurements of isometric knee-extension torque at maximal voluntary contraction (MVC force), knee stability tests, the International Knee Ligament Standard Evaluation Form and the Tegner activity score. A sensitive method of twitch interpolation was used to quantify the VA and to calculate true muscle force. Before operation we found a deficit of VA on both the injured (mean +/- SEM 74.9 +/- 3.5%) and the uninjured side (74.6 +/- 3.0%) in comparison with the control group (91 +/- 0.9%). Two years after reconstruction of the ACL the VA improved significantly on both sides but remained less than that of the controls. Correlation analysis revealed an improvement of the VA in patients who returned to a higher level of activity. The deficit of true muscle force, however, persisted regardless of the clinical outcome and ligament stability.

TI  - Single-joint Hybrid Assistive Limb in Knee Rehabilitation after ACL Reconstruction: An Open-label Feasibility and Safety Trial.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Objectives" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To achieve better outcomes, neuromuscular and biomechanical factors should be considered in rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and safety of a wearable exoskeleton robot suit [known as the single-joint hybrid assistive limb (HAL-SJ)] and whether knee training using this device could improve functional outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">HAL-SJ-assisted knee extension and flexion exercises were commenced in 11 patients 18 weeks after reconstruction; exercises were performed once a week for three weeks at a frequency of five sets of ten repetitions. Patients were monitored for HAL-SJ-related adverse events. Physical evaluations were conducted before and after HAL-SJ training. Surface electromyography of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles was performed in 4 of the 11 patients during each session and the muscle co-contraction index was calculated.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The peak muscle torque was higher at all velocities after HAL-SJ training. The active range of motion significantly increased in both extension and flexion, and the range of motion in passive flexion significantly increased. The Tegner Activity Scale and Lysholm Knee Questionnaire scores also significantly increased after knee HAL training. The muscle co-contraction index during extension tended to be lower after HAL-SJ training. No adverse events were observed.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusions" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The findings of this study indicate the feasibility and safety of HAL-SJ training as a neuromuscular rehabilitation tool after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The knee HAL-SJ training may have contributed to these results from a neurophysiological perspective by lowering the co-contraction of knee muscles, which would correct impairment of the antagonistic or synergistic muscles.</AbstractText>

TI  - Males and females have different muscle activity patterns during gait after ACL injury and reconstruction.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Kinematic and kinetic changes following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture and reconstruction (ACLR) have been fundamental to the understanding of mechanical disrupted load as it contributes to the development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis. These analyses overlook the potential contribution of muscle activity as it relates to the joint loading environment. Males and females classified as non-copers present with unique knee kinematics and kinetics after ACL injury. The purpose of this study was to perform sex-specific analyses in these individuals to explore muscle activity timing during gait after ACL rupture. Thirty-nine participants (12 females, 27 males) were enrolled. Muscle activity during gait was evaluated before and after pre-operative physical therapy, and six months after ACLR. Surface electromyography data were evaluated to determine timing (e.g., the time the muscle activity begins ('On') and ends ('Off')) for seven muscles: vastus lateralis and medialis (VL, VM), lateral and medial hamstrings (LH, MH), lateral and medial gastrocnemius (LG, MG), and soleus (SOL). General linear models with generalized estimating equations detected the effects of limb and time for muscle activity timing. Males presented with more limb asymmetries before and after pre-operative PT in the VL On (p < 0.001) and Off (p = 0.007), VM On and Off (p < 0.001), and MH off (p < 0.001), but all limb differences resolved by six months post ACLR. Changes in muscle activity in males were pervasive over time in both limbs. Females presented with no interlimb differences pre-operatively, and only involved limb VL off (p = 0.027) and VM off (p = 0.003) and the LH off in both limbs (p < 0.038) changed over time. Our data indicate that inter-limb differences in muscle activity across time points and changes in muscle activity timing over the course of physical therapy were sex specific. Males presented with more inter-limb differences in muscle activity across time points, and females presented with fewer asymmetries before and after pre-operative physical therapy. These data support that sex-specific adaptations should be taken into consideration when assessing biomechanical changes after ACLR.

TI  - Patient reported outcome measures in meniscal tears and arthroscopic meniscectomy: The value of outcome score prediction.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Background There are several clinical outcome scores relating to meniscal injuries reported in the literature. However, the result of one scoring system is often different from that of the others even when assessing the same group of patients. This makes the comparison of results of studies who have used different outcome measures restrictive and difficult. Hypothesis Statistically derived formulae can be used to predict the outcome of one knee scoring system when the result of another is known in patients with meniscal tears before and after arthroscopic meniscectomy. Patients and methods Thirty-four patients with meniscal tears were evaluated using nine clinical outcome scores. These included Tegner Activity Score, Lysholm Knee Score, Cincinnati Knee Score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Objective Knee Score, Tapper and Hoover Meniscal Grading Score, IKDC Subjective Knee Score, Knee Outcome Survey–Activities of Daily Living Scale, Short Form-12 Item Health Survey (SF-12) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Twenty-nine patients underwent an arthroscopic meniscectomy and were reassessed 3 months post-operatively. Results There were considerable differences between the mean total of each of the nine outcome measures. Significant correlations and regressions were found between most of the outcome scores and were stronger following surgery. The strongest correlation was found between IKDC Subjective and SF-12 Physical Component Summary sub-score (r = 0.94, P  Discussion The outcome of one knee score can be predicted when the results of the other are known through formulae calculations produced from this study. This could facilitate the conduct of systematic reviews and meta-analysis in research pertaining to meniscal injuries by allowing the pooling of substantially more data. Level of evidence II; prospective non-randomized trial.

TI  - New Classification and Visual Analysis of the Patella Cartilage during Total Knee Replacement
PY  - 2021
AB  - Objective: The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate how much damage the patellar cartilage presents during a total knee replacement. Methods: The damage of the articular patellar surface was analysed by visual inspection and photographs in 354 primary total knee replacements. The authors graded the degree of cartilage lesion in five groups. The cartilage status was analyzed and correlated with age, gender, side, body mass index (BMI), Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic scale and axial deviation. Results: After statistical analysis, we concluded: there was no evidence of an association between patellar arthrosis and age gender, side, weight and deformity. Conclusions: Articular cartilage was damaged in all 354 knees. Important subchondral bone exposure occurred in 274 knees (77.4%). Obese patients had more severe patellar osteoarthritis.

TI  - Functional Outcomes of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Titanium Adjustable Loop Button and Poly-L-co-DL-Lactic Acid-Beta Tricalcium Phosphate (PLDLA-bTCP) Interference Screws: A Single-Center, Retrospective, Observational Study.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Background The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a standard surgery in patients with instability of the knee caused by ACL insufficiency. Several differential procedures using grafts and implants such as loops, buttons, and screws have been described. This study aimed to assess the functional outcomes of ACL reconstruction surgery using titanium adjustable loop buttons and poly-L-co-DL-lactic acid-beta tricalcium phosphate (PLDLA-bTCP) interference screws. Methodology This was a retrospective, observational, single-center, and clinical study. A total of 42 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction at a tertiary trauma center in northern India between 2018 and 2022 were recruited. Data including demographics, details of the injury, surgery, implants, and surgical outcomes were collected from the patients' medical records. Further, post-surgery details such as re-injury, adverse events, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) profiles, and Lysholm knee score were recorded from the enrolled patients through a telephonic follow-up. Pain score and Tegner activity scale were used to compare the knee status before and after surgery. Results At the time of surgery, the mean age of the recruited patients was 31.1 ± 8.8 years, with a male preponderance of 93%. About 57% of patients had left knee injuries. The common symptoms were instability (67%), pain (62%), swelling (14%), and giving away (5%). During surgery, titanium adjustable loop button and PLDLA-bTCP interference screw implants were used in all patients. The mean follow-up time was 21.2 ± 14.2 months. Based on patient responses, the mean IKDC and Lysholm scores were found to be 54.02 ± 5.93 and 94.4 ± 4.73, respectively. Further, the proportion of patients reporting pain decreased from 62% before surgery to 21% after surgery. The mean Tegner score revealed a significant increase in the activity levels of the patients post-surgery compared to pre-surgery (p < 0.05). Lastly, no adverse events or re-injuries were reported in any of the patients during follow-up. Conclusions Our findings revealed a significant improvement in Tegner activity levels and pain scores after surgery. In addition, patient-reported IKDC and Lysholm scores fell under the category of good knee status and function, suggesting a satisfactory functional outcome of ACL reconstruction. Hence, titanium adjustable loop and PLDLA-bTCP interference screws may be a good choice of implants for successful ACL reconstruction surgery.

TI  - Does surgery reduce knee osteoarthritis, meniscal injury and subsequent complications compared with non-surgery after ACL rupture with at least 10 years follow-up? A systematic review and meta-analysis
PY  - 2019
AB  - Objective We compared long-term follow-up from surgical versus non-surgical treatment of ACL rupture regarding radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA), secondary surgery, laxity and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library databases. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies directly comparing the minimally invasive surgical (arthroscopy or miniarthrotomy) and non-surgical treatment of ACL rupture with at least 10 years of follow-up in adult patients were included. Results Five studies met the eligibility criteria. A meta-analysis revealed a higher risk of radiographic knee OA and a lower risk of secondary meniscal surgery for patients in the surgical group. The risk of graft rupture/secondary ACL revision and secondary ACL reconstruction was equal in the surgical and non-surgical groups. Knee laxity was lower among patients in the surgical group in four studies. No difference was found in the PROMs (ie, International Knee Documentation Committee, Tegner, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome, and Lysholm scores). Conclusion The risk of radiographic knee OA was higher, but the risk of secondary meniscal injury was lower 10 years after surgical treatment of ACL rupture. The risk of graft rupture/secondary ACL revision or secondary reconstruction was unrelated to treatment type. The degree of knee laxity was reduced after surgical treatment in comparison with non-surgical treatment, while PROMs were similar. However, due to the methodological challenges highlighted in this systematic review, these findings must be interpreted with caution. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019119468

TI  - Comparing Transtibial and Anteromedial Drilling Techniques for Single-bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background: Among the many factors that determine the outcome following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, the position of the femoral tunnel is known to be critically important and is still the subject of extensive research. Objective: We aimed to retrospectively compare the outcomes of arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using transtibial (TT) or anteromedial (AMP) drilling techniques for femoral tunnel placement. Methods: ACL reconstruction was performed using the TT technique in 49 patients and the AMP technique in 56 patients. Lachman and pivot- shift tests, the Lysholm Knee Scale, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Tegner activity scale and visual analog scale (VAS) were used for the clinical and functional evaluation of patients. Time to return to normal life and time to jogging were assessed in addition to the radiological evaluation of femoral tunnel placement. Results: In terms of the Lysholm, IKDC, Tegner score, and stability tests, no significant differences were found between the two groups (p > 0.05). Statistical analysis revealed reduced time to return to normal life and jogging in the AMP group (p < 0.05). The VAS score was also significantly reduced in the AMP group (p < 0.05). The position of the femoral tunnel was anatomically appropriate in 51 patients in the AMP group and 5 patients in the TT group. Conclusion: The AMP technique is superior to the TT technique in creating anatomical femoral tunnel placement during single-bundle ACL reconstruction and provides faster recovery in terms of return to normal life and jogging at short-term follow-up.

TI  - Does Combined Reconstruction of the Medial Collateral and Anterior Cruciate Ligaments Provide Better Knee Function? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to determine if medial collateral ligament reconstruction (MCLR) alongside anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) preserves knee functionality better than isolated ACLR in combined ACL and MCL tears. <b>Methods:</b> MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CENTRAL, and Web of Science were searched systematically on 31 March 2023. Studies reporting post-operative function after ACLR and ACLR + MCLR in combined injuries were included. Outcomes included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, side-to-side difference (SSD), Lysholm, and Tegner scale values. <b>Results:</b> Out of 2362 papers, 8 studies met the criteria. The analysis found no significant difference in outcomes (MD = 3.63, 95% CI: [-5.05, 12.3] for IKDC; MD = -0.64, 95% CI: [-3.24, 1.96] for SSD at 0° extension; MD = -1.79, 95% CI: [-4.61, 1.04] for SSD at 30° extension; MD = -1.48, 95% CI: [-16.35, 13.39] for Lysholm scale; MD = -0.21, 95% CI: [-4.29, 3.87] for Tegner scale) between treatments. <b>Conclusions:</b> This meta-analysis found no significant difference in outcomes between ACLR and ACLR + MCLR, suggesting that adding MCLR does not provide additional benefits. Due to the heterogeneity and quality of the included studies, further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal treatment for combined severe MCL-ACL injuries.

TI  - Fixation of small tibial avulsion fracture of the posterior cruciate ligament using the double bundles pull-through suture method
PY  - 1999
AB  - Background: Avulsion of the tibial insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament is commonly repaired via open reduction and internal fixation with a screw, Kirschner's wire, and suture. In the case of a major bony fragment, this technique is adequate to achieve rigid fixation. In the case of an avulsion fracture with a small bony fragment, however, it is not uncommon to break the bone fragment during screw fixation. We describe a new technique for fixation of an avulsion fracture with a small bony fragment. The technique uses a double bundles pull-through suture technique that repairs the anterolateral and posteromedial components of the posterior cruciate ligament simultaneously. Methods: From March 1994 through May 1997, 12 patients with small tibial avulsion fractures of the posterior cruciate ligament were treated using this technique. Results: At an average of 18 months after surgery (range, 12-24 months), the preliminary clinical and radiographic results were satisfactory. Eleven patients could return to the same or a higher level of preinjury sports activity. According to the International Knee Documentation Committee rating system, 10 of the 12 patients had normal or nearly normal ratings. Conclusion: The double bundles pull-through suture technique can avoid the risk of breakage of the small bony fragment, does not require the removal of hardware, and can achieve adequate repair in the anatomic situation. Our clinical experience suggests that it is a good choice for fixation in cases of avulsion fracture with a small bony fragment.

TI  - Comparación de resultados funcionales después de la reconstrucción del ligamento cruzado anterior con autoinjerto de isquiotibiales: técnica de portal transtibial vs anteromedial
PY  - 2022
AB  - Introducción: Las lesiones del ligamento cruzado anterior totalizan entre 100,000 y 200,000 casos al año, cada año se realizan en Estados Unidos cerca de 100,000 reconstrucciones, cuyos buenos resultados oscilan entre 75 y 90%.La técnica más común de perforación de túnel femoral es la transtibial; sin embargo, actualmente hay un cambio en la elección a la anteromedial, la cual reconstruye el túnel femoral más anatómico, esto con el fin de mejorar la estabilidad rotacional.Objetivo: Comparar los resultados funcionales después de la reconstrucción del ligamento cruzado anterior con la técnica de perforación de túnel femoral transtibial versus anteromedial, en el paciente de la Unidad Médica de Atención Ambulatoria (UMAA) No. 90, Torreón, Coahuila, periodo 2020-2021.Material y métodos: Estudio comparativo, transversal y ambispectivo en pacientes con diagnóstico de lesión de ligamento cruzado anterior, a los cuales se les realizó reconstrucción en la UMAA No. 90 Torreón, Coahuila, México.Resultados: Se incluyeron 32 pacientes sometidos a reconstrucción de ligamento cruzado anterior con autoinjerto de isquiotibiales, 90.6% del sexo masculino.La edad promedio fue 27.7 ± 7.3, con rango de 17 a 45 años, 62.5% (n = 20) presentó lesión en rodilla derecha y 37.5% (n = 12) rodilla izquierda, 53.1% (n = 17) se sometió a técnica con abordaje anteromedial y 46.9% (n = 15) abordaje transtibial.No hubo diferencias significativas en los resultados (p < 0.05) al tercer y quinto mes, ambos grupos tuvieron resultados similares en el test Lysholm e IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee).Conclusiones: La reconstrucción del ligamento cruzado anterior con autoinjerto de isquiotibiales mediante las técnicas de túnel femoral anteromedial o transtibial demostraron resultados similares sin diferencias significativas a corto plazo.

TI  - A comparison of bone-patellar tendon-bone and bone-hamstring tendon-bone autografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Background: Most of the previous comparative studies between patellar tendon and hamstring tendon anterior cruciate ligament grafts compared grafts of different constructs fixed with different methods.Purpose: To compare patellar tendon and hamstring tendon grafts with the same fixation method used to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament.Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.Methods: During the reconstructive procedure, the hamstring tendon graft was prepared as a bone-hamstring-bone graft; both bone-patellar tendon-bone and bone-hamstring-bone grafts were fixed with interference screws. Eighty consecutive patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were randomly assigned to either bone-patellar tendon-bone or bone-hamstring-bone groups. Follow-up examinations were performed for at least 5 years postoperatively. Seventy-two of the 80 patients (37 patients in the bone-patellar tendon-bone group and 35 in the bone-hamstring-bone group) were evaluated, wit...

TI  - Factors Associated with Return to Sport After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Focus on Athletes Who Desire Preinjury Level of Sport.
PY  - 2024
AB  - In most previous studies investigating return to preinjury level of sport (RTPS) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), whether patients continue aiming for RTPS not only before but also after ACLR was unclear because environmental and social factors were not considered. Herein, we aimed to evaluate factors associated with RTPS among athletes who desired to achieve RTPS even after ACLR, excluding patients who no longer desire this goal owing to environmental and social factors. Ninety-two patients who underwent primary double-bundle ACLR with a minimum 2-year follow-up and desired to achieve RTPS before surgery were retrospectively enrolled. Twelve (13%) patients who no longer desired to achieve RTPS after ACLR owing to environmental and social factors were excluded. Sixty-nine patients were included in the final cohort. At the final follow-up, the patients were split into two groups: those who achieved (R group) or did not achieve (N group) RTPS based on patient self-assessment. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Lysholm scores were also determined. The anterior tibial translation in the Lachman test and acceleration and external rotational angular velocity (ERAV) in the pivot shift test were measured at the hardware removal operation. Significant differences were observed for preinjury level of sports between the groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The rate of RTPS in competitive athletes was lower than that in recreational athletes (20/46: 43% vs. 16/22: 73%; <i>p</i> =.037). Lysholm score, KOOS symptom, pain, and quality of life showed higher values in the R group than in the N group (<i>p</i> < 0.050). Acceleration was significantly lower in the R group than in the N group (<i>p</i> = 0.028). Competitive level of sports is a risk factor for failure to achieve RTPS. The postoperative functional outcomes in the group that achieved RTPS showed more favorable results. These results provide important information to enable the surgeons to consider the appropriate surgical plan for competitive athletes who desire to achieve RTPS after ACLR.

TI  - Gross osteolytic tibia tunnel widening with the use of Gore-Tex anterior cruciate ligament prosthesis: a radiological, arthrometric and clinical evaluation of 17 patients 13-15 years after surgery.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Background Postoperative widening of the bone tunnels have been found after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autologus bone-patellar tendon-bone or hamstring tendon grafts. These changes seem to be of no clinical significance in a short to midterm follow-up. We investigated if a synthetic graft evokes the same bone tunnel widening and if it is of clinical significance in a longterm follow-up.Methods We examined 17 patients, 13–15 years after their anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a Gore-Tex ligament prosthesis. The follow-up consisted of clinical examination, K-1000 arthrometric measurement, Tegner, Lysholm and IKDC scores, and CT examination of their tibia bone tunnels. 6 patients had been reoperated before follow-up, 3 because of graft rupture and 3 because of effusion and/or pain.Results 5 patients were graded as normal (n = 2) or nearly normal according to the IKDC score, and 4 of these patients still had their Gore-Tex prosthesis intact. 15 of the patients had a tibia bo...

TI  - Effect of Graft Choice for ACL Reconstruction on Clinical Outcomes in Combined ACL and MCL Injuries: Comparison Between Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone and Hamstring Autografts.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <b>Background/Objectives:</b> The optimal graft, particularly in combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries, remains controversial. We evaluated the influence of graft choice between bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) and hamstring autografts on clinical outcomes in combined ACL and MCL injuries. <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective analysis included patients with concurrent ACL and MCL injuries who underwent single-bundle ACL reconstruction with BPTB (group B) or hamstring (group H) grafts, between 2010 and 2019, with a ≥2-year follow-up. Patients were classified based on the MCL injury grade (I, II, or III). Clinical outcomes were assessed through knee stability evaluations using valgus stress radiographs and the KT-2000 arthrometer, patient-reported outcomes using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score and Lysholm score, and radiologic outcomes using the IKDC radiographic grade. <b>Results:</b> The study included 169 patients (group B, 92; group H, 77). No significant between-group differences in knee stability or functional outcomes were found after follow-up. Within the same MCL injury grade, particularly in high-grade MCL injuries, BPTB grafts resulted in significantly better medial stability (side-to-side difference in medial joint opening on valgus stress radiographs: grade II, <i>p</i> = 0.006; grade III, <i>p</i> = 0.039) and functional outcomes (IKDC subjective score: grade II, <i>p</i> = 0.045; grade III, <i>p</i> = 0.038) than hamstring grafts. In the hamstring group, higher-grade MCL injuries were associated with worse outcomes (Lysholm knee score, <i>p</i> = 0.009; IKDC subjective score, <i>p</i> = 0.015). <b>Conclusions:</b> Graft choice in ACL reconstruction with concomitant MCL injuries may affect clinical outcomes, particularly in high-grade MCL injuries. Although both graft types performed similarly overall, BPTB grafts provided superior medial stability and functional results in higher-grade MCL injuries. However, caution is needed when interpreting these results due to limitations such as the small sample size and the lack of randomization in graft selection.

TI  - Simultaneous arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament using hamstring and quadriceps tendon autografts.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Background: Most dislocated knees involved tears in the two cruciate ligaments were often accompanied by other collateral ligament complexes. Surgical repair or reconstruction seems to achieve results superior to conservative treatment. Various methods of reconstructing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) after knee dislocation have been described, but few reports discuss simultaneous ACL and PCL reconstructions in a single operation. Methods: Eleven consecutive patients (6 males and 5 females) with both ACL and PCL disruptions were enrolled in the prospective study and treated with arthroscopic combined reconstruction of ACL and PCL using hamstring and quadriceps tendon autografts in a single operation. The average period from injury to operation was 76 days (range, 30-150 days), and the mean age was 33 years (range, 19-48 years) for those who underwent the operation. Mean follow-up time was 55 months (range, 36-78 months). Follow-up examinations included Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, thigh muscle assessment, and radiographic evaluation. Results: Ten of 11 (91%) patients showed good or excellent results. Statistically significant improvements were observed in Lysholm score (p = 0.008), Tegner score (p = 0.038), postoperative KT-1000 scores (p = 0.001), final IKDC rating (p = 0.032), and thigh atrophy and muscle strength (p < 0.05). Regarding IKDC final rating, 82% (9 of 11) of the patients were assessed as normal or nearly normal (grade A or B). Conclusions: Simultaneous arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of both ACL and PCL using hamstring and quadriceps autografts can effectively and safely restore knee stability.

TI  - Anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries.
PY  - 2004
AB  - Knee pain is a common complaint in the primary care setting, and ACL and PCL injuries are common causes of knee pain. Therefore, it is important for the primary care physician to be skilled in the diagnosis and initial management of these injuries and to be aware of potential associated knee injuries. By understanding the history, mechanism of injury, physical examination maneuvers, and imaging modalities related to ACL and PCL injuries, primary care physicians can prepare themselves to make an accurate diagnosis. Then they can counsel the patients on the available treatments, initiate conservative treatment if appropriate, and facilitate an effective referral to a primary care sports medicine physician or orthopedic surgeon.

TI  - The Natural History of the Intercondylar Notch After Notchplasty
PY  - 1999
AB  - Ten patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by one surgeon using autologous patellar tendon grafts were evaluated. A standardized technique of performing a notchplasty was done to remove at least 5 mm of bone at the anterior outlet of the intercondylar notch. Computed tomography scans were done preoperatively, within 1 week postoperatively, and after 1 year of follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences in the measured dimensions of the intercondylar notch between 1 week and 1 year postoperatively. While previous investigations have evaluated the relationship between intercondylar notch dimensions and risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury, we believe this is the first statistical study that addresses the natural history of the intercondylar notch in humans after bone resection. We believe that the data reported here may enhance our understanding and treatment of patients who have undergone previously failed anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions.

TI  - Accuracy of frontal and sagittal plane correction in open-wedge high tibial osteotomy.
PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract Purpose: This study was performed to determine the accuracy of correction in the frontal plane and to evaluate whether a frontal plane correction influences the sagittal slope of the proximal tibial surface in open-wedge high tibial osteotomy. Type of Study: Retrospective review. Methods: In this study, 30 patients (32 knees) with a mean age of 38 years (range, 20 to 66 years) were available for follow-up evaluation at a minimum interval of 24 months (mean, 42 months; range, 24 to 62 months). A normal axis was planned for a varus morphotype without evidence of osteoarthrosis. If one third of the thickness of the medial cartilage was lost, the new mechanical axis was planned to pass lateral to the center of the knee at the 10% position (where the 0% position is at the center of the knee joint and the 100% position is at the lateral border of the plateau). When two thirds were lost, the new mechanical axis was planned to pass through the 20% position. If total cartilage loss was present, the mechanical axis was planned to pass through the 30% position. The correction was estimated as good when the mechanical axis was found to be approximately ± 5% of the width of the tibial plateau. The angle of the osteotomy and the size of the wedge-shaped bone graft were calculated using the "push" orthoradiogram. Results: Consolidation of the osteotomy was obtained after a mean period of 8.4 weeks (range, 6 to 13 weeks). The mean amount of valgus correction was 5.9°. Sixteen of 32 knees (50%) showed the desired position of the mechanical axis. Ten knees (31%) showed an undercorrection; 6 knees (19%) an overcorrection. The mean increase of the posterior tibial slope was 2.7° (range, −8° to 10°). Conclusions: The medial open-wedge osteotomy of the proximal tibia has a tendency to increase the posterior tibial slope. This effect is unfavorable in anterior knee instability because it increases the anterior translation of the tibia. Increasing the posterior slope can be favorable in posterior instability because it reduces the posterior sag. Level of Evidence: Level IV.

TI  - Effect of Cigarette Smoking on the Clinical Outcomes of ACL Reconstruction
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: We compared the clinical outcomes of nonsmokers, current smokers, and former smokers following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and investigated the association between the amount of smoking and outcomes following ACL reconstruction.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 251 patients who underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction with use of bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft between January 2002 and August 2009. Patients were divided into three groups according to smoking history: Group 1, nonsmokers; Group 2, current smokers; and Group 3, former smokers. Preoperative values and twenty-four-month postoperative findings were compared among the groups. The stability of the ACL was evaluated with use of the Lachman test and the pivot-shift test, and anterior translation was tested with a KT2000 arthrometer. Functional outcomes were assessed on the basis of the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score and objective grade.

Results: The three groups differed significantly in terms of postoperative knee translation, Lysholm score, and IKDC subjective score. The mean side-to-side difference in anterior translation (and standard deviation) was 2.08 ± 1.08 mm in Group 1 (nonsmokers), 2.65 ± 1.31 mm in Group 2 (smokers), and 2.15 ± 1.05 mm in Group 3 (former smokers) (p = 0.003). The mean Lysholm score was 90.5 ± 6.5 in Group 1, 86.0 ± 7.1 in Group 2, and 89.8 ± 6.3 in Group 3 (p < 0.001). The mean IKDC subjective score was 89.3 ± 5.1 in Group 1, 84.9 ± 7.5 in Group 2, and 88.5 ± 4.2 in Group 3 (p < 0.001). However, the difference in the IKDC subjective score among the three groups did not demonstrate a minimal clinically important difference. A dose-dependent association was noted between pack-years of exposure and postoperative anterior translation (estimate, 0.039; p = 0.015) and IKDC objective grade (odds ratio, 1.083; p = 0.002). A comparison of the three subgroups of smokers showed a significant difference in anterior translation (a mean side-to-side difference in anterior translation of 2.31 ± 1.17 mm for the light smokers, 2.60 ± 1.14 mm for the moderate smokers, and 3.29 ± 1.55 mm for the heavy smokers; p = 0.038). The three subgroups also differed significantly in terms of the proportion of cases by IKDC objective grade; among the light smokers, thirteen (42%) were grade A, fifteen (48%) were grade B, two (7%) were grade C, and one (3%) was grade D; among the moderate smokers, seven (35%) were grade A, eight (40%) were grade B, four (20%) were grade C, and one (5%) was grade D; and among the heavy smokers, one (6%) was grade A, eight (44%) were grade B, eight (44%) were grade C, and one (6%) was grade D (p = 0.013).

Conclusions: Cigarette smoking appeared to have a negative effect on subjective and objective outcomes of ACL reconstruction, and heavy smokers showed greater knee instability. Patients who had stopped smoking at least one month prior to ACL reconstruction had no significant difference in outcomes compared with patients who had never smoked.

Level of Evidence: Prognostic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Treatment of posterior cruciate ligament tibial avulsion fractures through a modified open posterior approach: operative technique and 12- to 48-month outcomes.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Objectives: To report clinical and functional outcomes following fixation of tibial posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) avulsion fractures through a modified open posterior approach when combined with a rehabilitation program emphasizing early range of motion. Design: Retrospective case series. Setting: Level I trauma center. Patients: From March 4, 2000 to May 8, 2003, there were 16 cases of PCL tibial avulsion injuries presented to our institution, with 10 patients available for follow up at 12 to 48 months (mean 28 months). Intervention: Fixation of tibial PCL avulsion fractures was with a lag screw and washer placed through a modified open posterior approach. Range of motion was begun on postoperative day 1. Main Outcome Measurements: Clinical stability, range of motion, gastrocnemius muscle strength, radiographic appearance, and each patient's overall health-related quality of life (using the musculoskeletal functional assessment tool) were evaluated at final follow up. Results: The average musculoskeletal functional assessment score was 14. (Musculoskeletal functional assessment scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating poorer function.) All patients achieved union of their fracture and had clinically stable knees at the latest follow-up. Flexion difference greater than 10 degrees (P = 0.16), extension difference greater than 2 degrees (P = 0.38), and heel raise difference more than 8 repetitions (P = 0.23) were not demonstrated in comparison to the normal side. Conclusions: Treatment of tibial PCL avulsion fractures, which includes fixation through a modified open posterior approach and early postoperative range of motion, results in healing of the fracture, good functional outcomes, stability to posterior draw testing, and does not lead to gastrocnemius weakness or significant range of motion deficits at 12 to 48 months postoperatively.

TI  - A 10-Year Prospective Trial of a Patient Management Algorithm and Screening Examination for Highly Active Individuals With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Part 1, Outcomes
PY  - 2007
AB  - Background A treatment algorithm and screening examination have been developed to guide patient management and prospectively determine potential for highly active individuals to succeed with nonoperative care after anterior cruciate ligament rupture. Objective To prospectively characterize and classify the entire population of highly active individuals over a 10-year period and provide final outcomes for individuals who elected nonoperative care. Methods Inclusion criteria included presentation within 7 months of the index injury and an International Knee Documentation Committee level I or II activity level before injury. Concomitant injury, unresolved impairments, and a screening examination were used as criteria to guide management and classify individuals as noncopers (poor potential) or potential copers (good potential) for nonoperative care. Results A total of 832 highly active patients with subacute anterior cruciate ligament tears were seen over the 10-year period; 315 had concomitant injuries, 87 had unresolved impairments, and 85 did not participate in the classification algorithm. The remaining 345 patients (216 men, 129 women) participated in the screening examination a mean of 6 weeks after the index injury. There were 199 subjects classified as noncopers and 146 as potential copers. Sixty-three of 88 potential copers successfully returned to preinjury activities without surgery, with 25 of these patients not undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at the time of follow-up. Conclusion The classification algorithm is an effective tool for prospectively identifying individuals early after anterior cruciate ligament injury who want to pursue nonoperative care or must delay surgical intervention and have good potential to do so.

TI  - Single- and Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Patients Aged Over 50 Years
PY  - 2012
AB  - Purpose The purpose of our study was to retrospectively evaluate the outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with hamstring in patients aged 50 years or older. In addition, we present, for the first time, the outcomes of a subgroup of middle-aged patients treated with double-bundle (DB) reconstruction. Methods Fifty patients aged 50 years or older underwent primary ACL reconstruction with hamstring. Inclusion criteria were primary ACL reconstruction in active patients. Exclusion criteria were multiligamentous injuries and a contralateral ACL-deficient knee. The mean age at surgery was 54.4 years (range, 50 to 65 years). The mean period from the initial injury to surgery was 32.6 months (range, 3 to 125 months). Of the patients, 36 underwent single-bundle (SB) ACL reconstruction and 14 underwent DB reconstruction. Patients were assessed preoperatively with physical examination (including range of motion, pivot-shift test, and instrumented knee laxity measurement), the Lysholm score, the International Knee Documentation Committee scoring system, and the Tegner activity scale. Standard radiographs were taken, and degenerative changes were graded according to the Ahlback radiologic classification of arthritis. Results Patients were evaluated at a mean of 4.4 years (range, 2 to 7 years) after surgery. A significant improvement in knee function and symptoms was reported in most patients, with increased Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee, and Tegner scores ( P P P = not significant). Conclusions Operative treatment showed favorable outcomes in most of the ACL-reconstructed patients with regard to knee stability, osteoarthritis progression, and patient satisfaction in a cohort of subjects aged 50 years or older. Our subgroup of patients undergoing DB ACL reconstruction reported average satisfactory outcomes, which did not significantly differ from the SB group. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Partial medial meniscectomy leads to altered walking mechanics two years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Meniscal repair does not.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Background Partial meniscectomy dramatically increases the risk for post-traumatic, tibiofemoral osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Concomitant medial meniscus surgery influences walking biomechanics (e.g., medial tibiofemoral joint loading) early after ACLR; whether medial meniscus surgery continues to influence walking biomechanics two years after ACLR is unknown. Research question Does medial meniscus treatment at the time of ACLR influence walking biomechanics two years after surgery? Methods This is a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data from a clinical trial (NCT01773317). Fifty-six athletes (age 24 ± 8 years) with operative reports, two-year biomechanical analyses, and no second injury prior to two-year testing participated after primary ACLR. Participants were classified by concomitant medial meniscal status: no medial meniscus involvement (n = 36), partial medial meniscectomy (n = 9), and medial meniscus repair (n = 11). Participants underwent biomechanical analyses during over-ground walking including surface electromyography; a validated musculoskeletal model estimated medial compartment tibiofemoral contact forces. Gait variables were analyzed using 3 × 2 ANOVAs with group (medial meniscus treatment) and limb (involved versus uninvolved) comparisons. Results There was a main effect of group (p = .039) for peak knee flexion angle (PKFA). Participants after partial medial meniscectomy walked with clinically meaningfully smaller PKFAs in both the involved and uninvolved limbs compared to the no medial meniscus involvement group (group mean difference [95%CI]; involved: −4.9°[−8.7°, −1.0°], p = .015; uninvolved: −3.9°[−7.6°, −0.3°], p = .035) and medial meniscus repair group (involved: −5.2°[−9.9°, −0.6°], p = .029; uninvolved: −4.7°[−9.0°, −0.3°], p = .038). The partial medial meniscectomy group walked with higher involved versus uninvolved limb medial tibiofemoral contact forces (0.45 body weights, 95% CI: −0.01, 0.91 BW, p = 0.053) and truncated sagittal plane knee excursions, which were not present in the other two groups. Significance Aberrant gait biomechanics may concentrate high forces in the antero-medial tibiofemoral cartilage among patients two years after ACLR plus partial medial meniscectomy, perhaps explaining the higher osteoarthritis rates and offering an opportunity for targeted interventions. Level of Evidence Level III.

TI  - Higher Rates of Residual Postoperative Instability after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Female Patients: A Systematic Review of Level II Studies.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Purpose" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To compare revision rates and residual postoperative instability after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction based on biological sex.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A systematic review was conducted according to the 2020 PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane library databases were queried from database inception through October 2022. Level I and II prospectively-enrolling human clinical studies that compared revision rates and physical examination of postoperative stability after ACL reconstruction between male and female patients were included. Outcomes were stratified by patient sex and quantitatively compared using a χ<sup>2</sup> test. Study quality was assessed using the MINORS criteria.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Four studies consisting of 406 patients (50% males) with a mean age of 25 years (range, 13.9-62 years) were identified. Mean follow-up time was 34.4 months (range, 22-60 months). Hamstring tendon autografts were used in 62% of ACL reconstructions in males and in 65% of ACL reconstructions in females, whereas bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts were used in 38% and 35% of procedures in males and females, respectively. A residual positive Lachman test result was more frequently reported among females compared to males (5.8% vs 0.6%; <i>P</i> = 0.03). No significant difference in revision rates or residual pivot-shift on examination was observed between males and females (<i>P</i> = 0.38 and <i>P</i> = 0.08, respectively).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Female patients undergoing ACL reconstruction have higher reported rates of residual anterior instability with Lachman than male patients.

TI  - Outcomes after repair of chronic bucket-handle tears of medial meniscus.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes after repair of chronic bucket-handle medial meniscal tears by use of magnetic resonance imaging, clinical examination, and patient-reported outcomes. Methods A retrospective review of patients with chronic bucket-handle medial meniscal tears that had been repaired with meniscal sutures was undertaken. The following criteria for inclusion were adopted: minimum tear length of 2 cm and chronic medial meniscal tear identified at the time of arthroscopy. The tears were susceptible to dislocation with probing. Data collected included demographic, clinical, radiologic, and surgical data. Postoperative healing was assessed with the clinical criteria of Barrett et al. The International Knee Documentation Committee rating, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity level were determined, and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate healing in accordance with the criteria of Henning et al. Results Twenty-four patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean time from injury to surgery was 10 months (range, 2 to 60 months). Sixteen patients underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, 1 patient underwent posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and 6 patients underwent meniscus repair only. A median of 5 sutures (range, 3 to 6 sutures) were used for repair. Four cases (all of which had undergone meniscus repair only) required revision. Complete healing was achieved in 83% of cases according to the criteria of Barrett et al. The mean follow-up time was 48 months (range, 24 to 112 months). An International Knee Documentation Committee rating of A or B was achieved in the 20 patients who did not require revision. The median Lysholm score was 95 (range, 92 to 100). The median Tegner activity level before injury was 7, and it remained unchanged after surgery in all cases. Conclusions This study showed that repair of chronic bucket-handle meniscal tears can lead to good clinical outcomes and a relatively low (17%) failure rate. In addition, repairs of isolated meniscal tears had a significantly higher risk of failure than repairs performed in conjunction with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

TI  - Increased Medial Meniscal Slope Is Associated With Greater Risk of Ramp Lesion in Noncontact Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background:A special type of meniscal lesion involving the peripheral attachment of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus (PHMM), termed ramp lesion, is commonly associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, no study has investigated its anatomic risk factors. Recently, increased meniscal slope has been identified as an independent anatomic risk factor for noncontact ACL injury.Hypothesis:Increased medial meniscal slope (MMS) as measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will correlate with greater risk of concomitant ramp lesion in noncontact ACL injury.Study Design:Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:From January 2011 to December 2013, a total of 1012 consecutive patients were diagnosed as having noncontact ACL injuries and underwent primary ACL reconstructions. Among them, 160 patients were arthroscopically verified to have concomitant ramp lesions. Study exclusion criteria included partial ACL rupture, multiligamentous injury, associated medial/lateral meniscal l...

TI  - The value of conservative treatment in ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).
PY  - 2007
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thirty-eight of the 73 consecutive acute ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) proven by a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) in skeletally mature patients (16-55 years old) were classified as suitable for primarily conservative treatment. Patient selection was performed using a preoperative screening protocol based on the structural damage, clinical symptoms, compliance, sportive activity, and the consent of a well-informed patient. METHODS: In 12 of the 38 treated patients, the conservative protocol showed a good to very good outcome, 2 patients had persistent giving-way and were considering ACL reconstruction, 14 patients had a secondary ACL reconstruction in our clinic (average 5.3 months after injury), 9 patients were operated on in other hospitals (average 13.3 months after injury), and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. RESULTS: All patients with successful conservative treatment were able to perform low-risk pivoting sports and two patients are practicing high-risk pivoting sports. The average International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was 92.5 (82.8-98.9); the subjective overall knee function was 93% (60% to 100%). Of the 12 patients with good and very good results, 6 continued playing the same sports at an unreduced intensity, 4 patients reduced their activities slightly, and 1 patient played more sports than before. CONCLUSIONS: Although the authors performed a preoperative screening to select patients suitable for conservative treatment, almost two-thirds of the primarily conservatively treated ACL ruptures needed an operative reconstruction in the long term. In one-third of the patients, conservative treatment led to a good or very good result. At the endpoint of the study only 12 (16%) of a total of 73 patients with acute injuries of the ACL had successful conservative treatment. Therefore, patients must be comprehensively instructed about the treatment program and the chances of success of conservative ACL treatment.

TI  - Approximately half of pediatric or adolescent patients undergoing revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction return to the same level of sport or higher: A systematic review.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To summarise the surgical techniques and clinical outcomes in paediatric and adolescent patients undergoing revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (r-ACLR).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Three databases (MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE) were searched from inception to 29 July 2023. The authors adhered to the PRISMA and R-AMSTAR guidelines as well as the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Data on demographics, surgical details, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), rates of instability, rupture and return to sport (RTS) were extracted.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Eight studies comprising 706 (711 knees) patients were included (48.7% female). The mean age at r-ACLR was 17.1 years (range: 16.5-18.0). Autografts (67.5%) were more common than allografts (32.2%) in revision, with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) being the most prevalent autograft source (59.6%). Bone grafts were used in seven patients (4.8% of 146 patients). The most common femoral and tibial fixation techniques were interference screws (37.6% and 38.1%, of 244 patients, respectively). The most common tunnelling strategy was anatomic (69.1% of 236 patients), and meniscus repairs were performed in 39.7% of 256 patients. The re-rupture rate was 13.0% in 293 patients. RTS at the same level or higher was 51.6% in 219 patients. The mean (SD) Lysholm score was 88.1 (12.9) in 78 patients, the mean (SD) Tegner score was 6.0 (1.6) in 78 patients, and the mean (SD) IKDC score was 82.6 (16.0) in 126 patients.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">R-ACLR in paediatric and adolescent patients predominantly uses BPTB autografts and interference screw femoral and tibial fixation with concomitant meniscal procedures. Rates of re-rupture and RTS at the same level or higher were 13.0% and 51.6%, respectively. Information from this review can provide orthopaedic surgeons with a comprehensive understanding of the most commonly used operative techniques and their outcomes for revision ACLR in this population.</AbstractText>

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">The extent to which recurrent patellar instability (RPI) affects wrestlers has not been thoroughly examined.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">To assess return to wrestling (RTW), patient-reported outcomes, and reoperation rates after patellofemoral stabilization surgery (PFSS) for RPI in a cohort of competitive wrestlers.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">All competitive wrestlers with a history of RPI and subsequent PFSS performed at a single institution between 2000 and 2020 were identified. Primary PFSS procedures included medial patellofemoral (MPFL) reconstruction (n = 31; 50%); MPFL repair (n = 22; 35.5%); or other PFSS (n = 9; 14.5%), such as tibial tubercle osteotomy, lateral retinacular release, and/or medial retinacular reefing. Exclusion criteria included revision PFSS or concomitant anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction or multiligament knee injury. Surgical failure was defined as subsequent patellar dislocation despite operative management or need for secondary PFSS.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Ultimately, 62 knees in 56 wrestlers with a mean age of 17.0 years (range, 14.0-22.8 years) were included at a mean follow-up of 6.6 years (range, 2.0-18.8 years). RTW occurred in 55.3% of wrestlers at a mean ± SD 8.8 ± 6.7 months. Among PFSS types, no differences were observed in rates of RTW (<i>P</i> = .676), postoperative pain (<i>P</i> = .176), Tegner activity level (<i>P</i> = .801), International Knee Documentation Committee (<i>P</i> = .378), Lysholm (<i>P</i> = .402), or Kujala scores (<i>P</i> = .370). RPI was the most common postoperative complication (n = 13; 21.0%). MPFL reconstruction had the lowest rate of RPI (6.5% vs 27.3% [repair] vs 55.6% [other]; <i>P</i> = .005) and surgical failure (9.7% vs 31.8% [repair] vs 55.6% [other]; <i>P</i> = .008). Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from surgical failure of the entire cohort was 91.9% at 1 year, 77.7% at 5 years, and 65.7% at 15 years. MPFL reconstruction had the highest survivorship when compared with MPFL repair and other PFSS up to 10 years after the index surgery (90.3% vs 64.1% vs 27.8%; <i>P</i> = .048).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">RPI remains a concern for competitive wrestlers after PFSS. MPFL reconstruction may serve as a more durable surgical treatment option with lower rates of RPI and failure when compared with other PFSS procedures at up to 10 years after surgery.</AbstractText>

TI  - Patellar tendon graft vs. Semitendinosus and Gracilis graft for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: An isokinetic and functional study one year after the operation
PY  - 2008
AB  - Objective: To compare the outcomes of arthroscopic reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) by means of the double bundle technique with the ipsilateral semitendinosus and gracilis (St-Gr) and the single bundle technique with the ipsilateral patellar tendon (PT). Methods and measures : 14 patients had randomly been assigned to either PT ot St-Gr graft for PCL reconstruction. The IKDC Knee Ligament Evaluation Form, the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, the Cincinnati Knee Rating Scale and concentric isokinetic knee extensor-flexor test at 60 and 180 ◦ /s were used to compare the results. Results: there were no significant differences in the clinical scores. The isokinetic tests, however, disclosed a significant loss of strength at the harvest site. Conclusion: since biomechanical considerations underscore the importance of recovery of the quadriceps after PCL reconstruction, employment of the semitendinous and gracilis with a possible loss of flexor strength could be rationally more acceptable solution than reconstruction with the patellar tendon and weakening of the extensors.

TI  - Mismatch between Clinical-Functional and Radiological Outcome in Tibial Plateau Fractures: A Retrospective Study.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">The evaluation of tibial plateau fractures (TPF) encompasses the assessment of clinical-functional and radiological parameters. In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the potential correlation between these parameters by utilizing both the clinical-functional and the modified radiological Rasmussen score.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">In this retrospective monocentric study conducted at a level-I trauma center, patients who underwent surgery between January 2014 and December 2019 due to a TPF were included. The clinical-functional Rasmussen score prior to the injury, at 1-year postoperatively, and during the last follow-up (minimum 18 months) was assessed using a standardized questionnaire. Additionally, the modified radiological Rasmussen score was determined at the 1-year postoperative mark using conventional radiographs in two planes.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 50 patients were included in this study, comprising 40% (n = 20) men, and 60% (n = 30) women, with an average age of 47 ± 11.8 years (range 26-73 years old). Among them, 52% (n = 26) had simple fractures (classified according to Schatzker I-III), while 48% (n = 24; according to Schatzker IV-VI) had complex fractures. The mean follow-up was 3.9 ± 1.6 years (range 1.6-7.5 years). The functional Rasmussen score assessed before the injury and at follow-up showed an "excellent" average result. However, there was a significant difference in the values of complex fractures compared to before the injury. One year postoperatively, both the clinical-functional score and the modified radiological score demonstrated a "good" average result. The "excellent" category was more frequently observed in the functional score, while the "fair" category was more common in the radiological score. There was no agreement between the categories in both scores in 66% of the cases.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The data from this retrospective study demonstrated that patients with TPF are able to achieve a nearly equivalent functional level in the medium-term after a prolonged recovery period, comparable to their pre-injury state. However, it is important to note that the correlation between clinical-functional and radiological parameters is limited. Consequently, in order to create prospective outcome scores, it becomes crucial to objectively assess the multifaceted nature of TPF injuries in more detail, both clinically and radiologically.</AbstractText>

TI  - Isokinetic Strength Training Improves Knee Symptoms and Function as Evaluated with 2000 IKDC
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background: Knee pain is most common complaint in athletes which may be caused by physical activity and exercises with many other causative factors. Sports injuries may lead to decline in muscle strength. This loss of muscular strength is strongly associated with decline in athletic performance. Improvement in strength may result in improved physical functions in injured athletes.
	Aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of isokinetic strength training in athletes with knee pain.
	Subjects: The average age of the athletes was 23.48 ± 4.71 years (Range: 18 - 34). Mean body mass of the athletes was 63.35 ± 15.52 kg (Range: 39 - 93.90). 25 male and 1 female athletes participated in this study.
	Methods: 25 athletes with knee pain completed the isokinetic strength training sessions by using Biodex Isokinetic system 10 sessions on alternate day basis. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 form was used to assess the functional status and symptoms of the athletes at baseline and after completing 10 sessions.
	Results: The average IKDC score was 45.64 (Range20.68-62.06) at baseline and 84.08 (range 68.96- 93.1) after completion of 10th sessions. Significant improvement was there when paired sample T test was used to find out pre and post changes in individual items of IKDC. Most of the individual items improved significantly as p value is <0.001.
	Conclusion: Isokinetic strength training significantly improves knee symptoms, level of sports activities, and function in patients with athletic knee pain

TI  - The use of platelet-rich fibrin with platelet-rich plasma support meniscal repair surgery
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Introduction Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is the only autologous blood product that releases growth factors and has scaffolding properties. We hypothesized that the use of PRF and Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) would improve operative results, including the recovery of function and repaired meniscus. Materials and Methods Seventeen patients underwent arthroscopic meniscus repair with PRF and PRP (PRF group) using our novel device for the injection of the PRF into the joint. Another five patients as a control group underwent meniscal repair without PRF and PRP (non-PRF group). The groups were compared in terms of clinical results (Tegner Activity Level Scale, Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, and International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] scores) and changes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings before surgery and 6 months after surgery. Results The Lysholm and IKDC scores improved in all patients postoperatively. However, there was no significant differencies in the postoperative score between the PRF group and the non-PRF group. Follow-up MRI findings did not clearly show improvements. Conclusions PRF and PRP are autologous, safe, and cost-effective sources of growth factors. Therefore, we propose a new application of PRF and PRP for autologous transplantation in meniscus repair surgery.

PY  - 2003
AB  - Background: Long-term outcome after anterior cruciate ligament injury among top-level pivoting athletes is unknown.Purpose: To evaluate outcome among competitive team handball players after anterior cruciate ligament injury.Study Design: Prospective cohort study.Methods: A previously studied group of 86 elite players who had an anterior cruciate ligament rupture were invited to participate in follow-up evaluations a mean of 7.8 years later.Results: Among the 57 operatively treated patients who returned for follow-up, 33 (58%) returned to team handball at their preinjury level, compared with 18 of 22 (82%) in the nonoperative group. Eleven of the 50 players (22%) who continued playing reinjured their anterior cruciate ligament when playing team handball. The overall Lysholm score was 85 ± 13 in both groups, but the five players classified as poor were all operatively treated. Nearly half of the players had an International Knee Documentation Committee classification of abnormal or severely abnormal. There ...

TI  - Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy Improves Outcome after Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Hamstring Tendons.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The decision regarding the timepoint of a return to sports after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is complex and depends on many factors, including objectively tested physical and psychological readiness as well as biological healing. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of repetitive extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) on return-to-sports duration, clinical results and MRI results after ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendons (HT).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="MATERIAL AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">In this prospective controlled study, all patients with acute ACL ruptures were treated by ACL reconstruction with HT. Patients were randomized into two groups (Group A: ESWT group; Group B: control group). Patients in the ESWT group received focused shockwave therapy 4, 5 and 6 weeks after ACL surgery. Follow-up investigations including IKDC score, Lysholm score, VAS and evaluation regarding return-to-sports timepoints that were conducted 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months post-operation. An MRI investigation was performed 12-months post-operation and graft maturation (signal intensity ratio (SIR)) as well as femoral and tibial tunnel characteristics (bone marrow oedema, tunnel fluid effusion) were assessed.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">In total, 65 patients (27.65 ± 7.07 years; 35 male/30 female) were included in this study. The mean timepoint for "return-to-pivoting-sports" was 27.92 weeks (±2.99) in the ESWT group as well as 42.64 weeks (±5.18) in the control group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In the ESWT group 31 patients (vs.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONTROL GROUP" NlmCategory="METHODS"><i>n</i> = 6) attained the "pre-injury activity level", whereas 6 patients (vs.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONTROL GROUP" NlmCategory="METHODS"><i>n</i> = 22) did not reach this level within 12 months post-operation. The IKDC score, Lysholm score, and VAS showed significant improvement in the ESWT group compared with the control group for all time-points (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The mean SIR in the ESWT group revealed 1.81 (±0.88), whereas the control group showed a mean SIR of 2.68 (±1.04) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="DISCUSSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In conclusion, this is the first study investigating the effect of repetitive ESWT on ACL reconstruction with clinical outcome measurements, including the duration of return-to-sports activity and an MRI follow-up examination. Return-to-sports parameters, clinical scores and graft maturation were significantly improved in the ESWT group. This study may support an earlier return-to-sports timepoint by ESWT and is of high clinical relevance as ESWT is a cost-effective treatment option with no relevant side effects.</AbstractText>

TI  - Unusual Complications in Knee Surgery from Around the World: Case Reports
PY  - 2001
AB  - The bone—patellar tendon—bone graft is considered the gold standard in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.1 The advantages of taking the central third of the patellar tendon are its grip force and the bone-to-bone fixation that favors a faster healing.2 Patellar tendon grafts can result in the following complications: patellofemoral pain, patellar tendinitis and patellar fracture, as well as extensor mechanism weakness.3 The morbidity rate of the patellar graft is currently a very controversial topic, but the English-language literature still considers the use of the central third of the patellar tendon the gold standard.

PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Arthroscopic repair of longitudinal tears in the medial meniscal posterior horn (MMPH) has been reported to result in high rates of meniscal healing when performed alongside anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, studies that have focused on longitudinal tears and their impact on clinical outcomes after arthroscopic repair are insufficient.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Purpose" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To investigate the clinical outcome and healing status after concomitant arthroscopic ACLR and repair of MMPH peripheral longitudinal tears, with respect to the tear length.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Study Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 263 patients who underwent concurrent arthroscopic suture repair of longitudinal tears of the MMPH and ACLR were enrolled. All patients had 2-year postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations, and 61% of patients underwent a second-look arthroscopy. The exclusion criteria were partial meniscectomies and multiligament injuries. Patients were assessed pre- and postoperatively for clinical scores, amount of anterior translation, grade of pivot shift, and presence of meniscal tear extension. According to the length of longitudinal tears, patients were classified into 2 groups: (1) patients with tears that were located in the posterior compartment and (2) patients with tears that extended to the midbody of the meniscus. Binary stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors for unhealed menisci as identified by MRI.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 83 patients were included in this study-52 patients (group 1) had MMPH tears without tear extension and 31 patients (group 2) had MMPH tears with tear extension. There were no differences in outcomes between the groups, including the healing rate after meniscal repair (<i>P</i> &gt; .05). Based on postoperative MRI scans, 67 patients (80.7%) were categorized as completely healed and 16 patients (19.3%) as unhealed. There were no significant differences between the completely healed and unhealed groups in outcomes or the rate of preoperative midbody tear extension. Higher body mass index and lower preoperative Lysholm scores were identified as risk factors for unhealed menisci.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Overall, the rate of complete healing of MMPH tears repaired concomitantly with ACLR was 80.7% (67/83), and midbody tear extension did not affect the healing rate of the repaired meniscus. Results indicate that suture repair for unstable MMPH tears should be considered regardless of tear size.</AbstractText>

TI  - Range of motion and quadriceps muscle power after early surgical treatment of acute combined anterior cruciate and grade-III medial collateral ligament injuries. A prospective randomized study.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Background Early operative treatment of combined anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligament injuries has frequently led to motion complications and slow quadriceps muscle power gains. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of early repair or nonoperative treatment of a concomitant medial collateral ligament injury on range of motion of the knee and quadriceps muscle strength in patients with combined injuries. Methods Forty-seven consecutive patients with combined anterior cruciate and grade-III medial collateral ligament injuries were randomized into two groups. The medial collateral ligament was repaired in Group I (n = 23) and was treated nonoperatively in Group II (n = 24). In both groups, the torn anterior cruciate ligament was treated with early reconstruction. The patients were evaluated on the basis of sequential range-of-motion measurements, the one-leg-hop test, and isokinetic muscle power measurements at the time of follow-up, and the findings were compared between the two treatment groups. Results All patients achieved full knee extension. At all follow-up intervals the flexion deficit was greater in the group that had been managed with surgical repair of both ligaments, but the difference was significant only at six weeks (100 degrees compared with 112 degrees; p = 0.009), twelve weeks (119 degrees compared with 128 degrees; p = 0.043), and thirty-six weeks (130 degrees compared with 136 degrees; p = 0.011) after the operation. The difference between the groups was not significant at fifty-two weeks (132 degrees compared with 137 degrees) or 104 weeks (134 degrees compared with 137 degrees). The quadriceps muscle power deficit at fifty-two weeks was 30.7% in the group that had been managed with combined repair and 20.5% in the group that had been managed with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction only (p = 0.015). At 104 weeks, the deficits were 14.4% and 9.7%, respectively (p = 0.2). Conclusions Early operative treatment of combined anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligament injuries is possible without increased long-term mobilization complications. The rehabilitation period is long, and aggressive physiotherapy is recommended. However, nonoperative treatment of the torn medial collateral ligament allows faster restoration of flexion and quadriceps muscle power. Our results favor nonoperative treatment of the torn medial collateral ligament in patients with combined injuries.

TI  - Musculoskeletal pain is not clearly associated with the risk of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in adolescents.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Objectives" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The purpose of this study was to investigate whether self-reported musculoskeletal pain (MSP) was associated with a future anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">In this population-based prospective cohort study, we included 8087 participants from the adolescent part of the Trøndelag Health Study (Young-HUNT) in Norway. The exposure was self-reported MSP from the Young-HUNT3 study (2006-2008), which was categorised into two MSP load groups (high MSP and low MSP) based on frequency and number of pain sites. The outcome was ACLRs recorded in the Norwegian Knee Ligament Register between 2006 and 2019. Logistic regression was used to investigate association between MSP load and ACLR, given as ORs with 95% CIs. All tests were two-sided and p values of ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">8087 adolescents were included. We identified a total of 99 ACLRs, with 6 ACLRs (0.9%) in adolescents who reported high MSP load and 93 ACLRs (1.3%) among those who reported low MSP load. Adolescents reporting high MSP load had 23% lower odds of an ACLR (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.91) compared with adolescents with low MSP load. However, the CIs were very wide.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Self-reported high MSP load in adolescents was not associated with increased risk of future ACLR. Although the number of participants was high, the relatively few cases of ACLR mean that we cannot be conclusive about the presence or absence of an association.</AbstractText>

TI  - The relationship between ACL deficiency, functional performance and a break in the isokinetic moment curve of the knee flexors
PY  - 2003
AB  - Changes in the isokinetic moment curve of the knee flexors have been proposed to be associated with functional instability in anterior cruciate ligament deficient (ACLD) patients. The purpose of this study was to assess if this relationship exists between breaks in the knee flexor moment curve and functional instability in an ACLD patient population. The study involved two groups: an asymptomatic control group (n = 20) and a second experimental group (n = 20) diagnosed as having an anterior cruciate ligament rupture. Both groups underwent isokinetic strength assessment of the knee flexors, with the moment curves being inspected for irregularities or breaks. All subjects also completed Lysholm and Tegner questionnaires and had a standardized assessment using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form. The findings of the questionnaires were then correlated with presence of breaks in the torque curve to assess association between these factors. Breaks in the knee flexor moment curve were established to occur in some patients with ACL deficiency; these patients also had lower scores on a variety of functional indices. Further investigation would appear to be warranted on a larger population to establish if the presence of break phenomena in knee flexor torque curves can be used to identify those patients who can and cannot cope with ACL deficiency.

TI  - Arthroscopic Management of Giant Meniscal Cysts Among Young Patients: An Average Three-Year MRI Follow-Up.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To describe an arthroscopic technique for giant meniscal cyst excision with preservation of the functional meniscus, report the short- and medium-term outcomes, and assess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for follow-up imaging evaluations.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A total of 54 consecutive patients with symptomatic meniscal cysts were admitted to the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between 2014 and 2019. Nine patients with giant meniscus cysts (six females and three males) were included in this study. The age range of the patients was 6-34 years. All patients underwent a complete physical examination, X-ray, Doppler ultrasound, and MRI of the knee preoperatively. After an arthroscopic diagnosis of a meniscal rupture with a giant meniscal cyst, partial meniscectomy, ablation of the cyst, and suturing of the retainable meniscus were performed. Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were used preoperatively and at the most recent follow-up. Clinical outcomes were classified into four categories: excellent, good, fair, and poor. During the last visit, all patients underwent MRI to assess the recurrence of the cyst and meniscal suture healing.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Preoperative MRI and arthroscopic examination revealed giant meniscal cysts combined with meniscal tears and congenital discoid meniscus, and all giant meniscal cysts occurred in the lateral meniscus. The main types of meniscal tears were horizontal and complex tears. The cysts were unicystic in one case and multicystic in eight cases. The mean size of the cysts on the MRI was 5.86 cm × 2.24 cm × 2.48 cm. The mean follow-up periods were 37.5 (19-60) months. Clinical outcomes were excellent in six patients and good in three patients. The postoperative scores were significantly improved compared to the preoperative scores (Lysholm: 90.78 ± 4.60 vs. 54.56 ± 7.25; IKDC: 96.2 ± 3.46 vs. 61.69 ± 3.36; p &lt;0.01). No recurrence of the cyst was indicated on the MRI, and there was good healing of the torn meniscus.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Arthroscopic cystectomy combined with the meniscus suture technique was effective to eradicate residual cyst cavities, and traffic orifices be highly recommended.</AbstractText>

TI  - Clinical and Laboratory Changes in the Uncomplicated Course of Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction: A Prospective Observational Study in 58 Patients
PY  - 2008
AB  - <jats:p> Knowledge of post-operative clinical and laboratory changes in the uncomplicated course of ACL reconstruction could assist orthopaedic surgeons in making a timely diagnosis of septic arthritis. A total of 58 candidates to ACL reconstruction were enrolled in this study according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Pre- and post-operative changes on 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup>, 3<jats:sup>rd</jats:sup>, 7<jats:sup>th</jats:sup>, 15<jats:sup>th</jats:sup>, and 30<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> day were collected for skin body temperature (SBT), knee pain (KP), white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP). Post-operative joint effusion was recorded when inhibiting quadriceps contraction. The post-operative changes were compared with baseline values at each time point in the whole sample and in the subgroups of patients receiving bone-patellar-tendon-bone (BPTP) or hamstring tendon (HT) autograft. Follow-up at six month was considered adequate to rule out surgery-related septic arthritis. Mean SBT significantly increased on 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup>, 3<jats:sup>rd</jats:sup> and 7<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> post-operative day and returned to values not differing from baseline on 15<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> and 30<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> day. Median KP was significantly elevated during the first month. Joint effusion was observed on 7<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> post-operative day in 52% of patients. Mean WBC count significantly increased on 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup>, 7<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> and 15<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> day while no difference from baseline was observed on 3<jats:sup>rd</jats:sup> and 30<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> day. Mean ESR was significantly elevated on 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> day, increased on 3<jats:sup>rd</jats:sup> day and peaked on 7<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> day. ESR decreased on 15<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> and 30<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> day but remained significantly higher than baseline. Mean CRP significantly increased on 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> day, peaked on 3<jats:sup>rd</jats:sup> day and decreased on 7<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> day, while levels on 15<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> and 30<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> day did not differ from baseline. The SBT, KP, WBC count, ESR and CRP changes stratified in relation to the type of autograft showed the same variation trend as in the whole sample. Close clinical surveillance may be advisable when SBT, occurrence of joint effusion and CRP levels deviate from the described reference trend two weeks after surgery. </jats:p>

TI  - Does Obesity Negatively Affect the Functional Results of Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy? A Retrospective Cohort Study
PY  - 2012
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on early functional results of patients who undergo isolated partial meniscectomy. Methods The functional results for 1,090 patients who underwent partial meniscectomy, in 2 different orthopaedic clinics, were evaluated retrospectively. The study includes cases with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for isolated meniscal tears; patients with concomitant knee pathology were excluded. Three hundred forty-one (31%) patients with isolated lateral meniscal tears, 628 (58%) patients with isolated medial meniscal tears, and 121 (11%) patients with both medial and lateral meniscal tears underwent arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. We divided these patients into 3 subgroups on the basis of their BMI; 26 Lysholm Knee Scale, 27 and Oxford Scoring System 28 scores. Results According to all 3 knee scales, age, side of lesion, and tear type had no effect on functional outcome. When compared with the group with BMI Conclusions Short-term outcomes after arthroscopic partial menisectomy reflect significant improvement in subjective outcome. However, patients with moderate or significant obesity (BMI >26) have inferior short-term outcomes compared with nonobese patients. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Extrasynovial ACL Tear as Potential Indicator for ACL Healing Capability: A Case Report of a Recreational Football Player With 3 Years of Serial Follow-up Tracking ACL Healing
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p> BACKGROUND: Potential structural anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) healing is receiving increased focus with several studies showing that variations of ACL healing capacities are possible. It is unknown if there are specific variations in ACL tears, which have higher probability of healing. </jats:p><jats:p> CASE PRESENTATION: We present a successful case of nonsurgical treatment of a complete ACL injury in a 34-year-old male recreational football player that showed proposed initial magnetic resonance imaging indicators of ACL healing potential: (1) the ligament fibers of the proximal and distal ends run mostly in the same direction (no displacement of ligament stumps), (2) no significant high signal intensity surrounding the torn ACL in water sensitive sequences, and (3) absence of significant joint effusion. </jats:p><jats:p> OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up included a series of 10 continuous magnetic resonance imaging examinations showing ACL healing progress in steps, as well as continuous clinical and biomechanical examination from injury to return to sport (4.5 months after injury) and until 3-year after injury. </jats:p><jats:p> DISCUSSION: We propose that an extrasynovial ACL tear might be an early indicator of ACL healing capability and provide considerations and illustrations, which may assist in the detection thereof. Further investigation and validation of this theory is encouraged. JOSPT Cases 2023;3(4):212-218. Epub 13 October 2023. doi:10.2519/josptcases.2023.11747 </jats:p>

TI  - Concomitant Lateral Meniscus Tear is Associated with Residual Rotatory Knee Instability 1 Year after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Case-cohort Study.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Lateral meniscus tear (LMT) accompanied by anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries has been reported to provoke rotatory instability of the affected knee joint. Unfortunately, these previous papers did not determine whether LMT-derived rotatory knee instability is residual because only preoperative or time zero data exists. This study aimed to longitudinally investigate how the prevalence of comorbid LMT is associated with residual rotatory knee instability (RKI) 1 year after ACL reconstruction (ACLR). A total of 327 patients who underwent double-bundle ACLR (average age: 23.4 years, body mass index: 23.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 215 females). The patients were divided into three groups based on arthroscopy: 1) intact lateral meniscus (LM); 2) unrepaired LMT; 3) repaired LMT. At the 1-year follow-up, the pivot-shift test was performed. The prevalence of RKI, determined according to IKDC grades (grade ≥1 denoted RKI), was compared with chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Thirty-eight patients (11.6%) had RKI; 203 subjects (62.1%) showed LMT, and 124 patients were diagnosed with an intact LM. Out of the 203 patients, 79 (38.9%) underwent LM repair. RKI was more prevalent in the LMT group than in the intact group (13.8% versus 8.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.117; Odds ratio: 1.499 [95%CI: 0.864 - 2.600]). In addition, the prevalence of RKI was significantly higher in the LM-repair group than in the intact-LM group (17.7% versus 8.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.038; Odds Ratio: 2.455 [95%CI: 1.032 - 5.842]). Medial meniscus tear (MMT) was detected in 113 patients (34.6%); RKI prevalence was not statistically different between the intact-MM group and the MMT group (12.2% versus 10.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.681). The current cohort study clarified that LMT comorbid with ACL injury was longitudinally associated with increased RKI prevalence 1 year after ACLR. Therefore, patients who underwent both ACLR and LM repair demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of residual RKI.

TI  - Surgical management of knee dislocations.
PY  - 2005
AB  - BACKGROUND:

The evaluation and management of knee dislocations remain variable and controversial. The purpose of this study was to describe our method of surgical treatment of knee dislocations with use of a standardized protocol and to report the clinical results.

METHODS:

Forty-seven consecutive patients presented with an occult (reduced) or grossly dislocated knee. Fourteen of these patients were not included in this series because of confounding variables: four had an open knee dislocation, five had vascular injury requiring repair, three were treated with external fixation, and two had associated injury. The remaining thirty-three patients underwent surgical treatment for the knee dislocation with our standard approach. Anatomical repair and/or replacement was performed with fresh-frozen allograft tissue. Thirty-one of the thirty-three patients returned for subjective and objective evaluation with use of four different knee-rating scales at a minimum of twenty-four months after the operation.

RESULTS:

Nineteen of the thirty-one patients were treated acutely (less than three weeks after the injury) and twelve, chronically. The mean Lysholm score was 91 points for the acutely reconstructed knees and 80 points for the chronically reconstructed knees. The Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living scores averaged 91 points for the acutely reconstructed knees and 84 points for the chronically reconstructed knees. The Knee Outcome Survey Sports Activity scores averaged 89 points for the acutely reconstructed knees and 69 points for the chronically reconstructed knees. According to the Meyers ratings, twenty-three patients had an excellent or good score and eight had a fair or poor score. Sixteen of the nineteen acutely reconstructed knees and seven of the twelve chronically reconstructed knees were given an excellent or good Meyers score. The average loss of extension was 1°, and the average loss of flexion was 12°. There was no difference in the range of motion between the acutely and chronically treated patients. Four acutely reconstructed knees required manipulation because of loss of flexion. Laxity tests demonstrated consistently improved stability in all patients, with more predictable results in the acutely treated patients.

CONCLUSIONS:

Surgical treatment of the knee dislocations in our series provided satisfactory subjective and objective outcomes at two to six years postoperatively. The patients who were treated acutely had higher subjective scores and better objective restoration of knee stability than did patients treated three weeks or more after the injury. Nearly all patients were able to perform daily activities with few problems. However, the ability of patients to return to high-demand sports and strenuous manual labor was less predictable.

Patients with International Cartilage Repair Society 3b or above cartilage grading in either their femur or tibia were classified as having substantial cartilage disease. Postoperative International Knee Documentation Committee, Tegner, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and Lysholm were compared between those with and without substantial cartilage disease. Kaplan-Meir analysis was used to assess the survival rates. Survival was defined as revision or removal of allograft or conversion to arthroplasty.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Data from 422 patients were included in the analysis with 129 patients found to have full-thickness chondral lesions and 281 patients without full-thickness chondral lesions. The mean follow-up was 6.33 (SD 3.48) years for the cohort. The mean age for the entire cohort was 30 (SD 9.23). Patients in substantial cartilage disease group underwent meniscal transplantation at an older age (32 [standard deviation {SD} 8.47] years vs. 29 [SD 9.35] years [p &lt; 0.001]). There was no significant difference in PROMs between the two groups up to 10 years postoperatively (p &gt; 0.05). The substantial cartilage disease group had significantly lower survival rates compared to those without (80.62% vs. 94.32%).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">MAT in the context of substantial cartilage disease was associated with an improvement in PROMs up to 10 years with no difference to the group without substantial cartilage disease. The PROMs in combination with the long-term survival rates in this study can be used to counsel patients preoperatively.</AbstractText>

TI  - The Dutch language short Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury scale has good to excellent construct validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability when assessing athletes undergoing rehabilitation after ACL injury or ACL reconstruction.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVES">To examine the validity and reliability of the Dutch language short Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury scale (short ACL-RSI-NL) in recreational athletes undergoing rehabilitation after ACL injury or ACL reconstruction (ACLR).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">The original 12-item version of the ACL-RSI had been translated into Dutch. Short ACL-RSI-NL items were derived from this 12-item Dutch version. Content validity was evaluated by a team consisting of eight ACL experts and eight athletes. A cohort of 115 athletes with ACL injury or after ACLR completed the short ACL-RSI-NL and related questionnaires at various time points during their rehabilitation. Construct validity (hypothesis testing using Spearman correlations), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), floor and ceiling effects (percentage of athletes having the lowest or highest score possible), and structural validity (exploratory factor analysis) were evaluated in the entire ACL athlete group. Test-retest reliability (using intra-class correlation, ICC; standard error of measurement, SEM; smallest detectable change, SDC, at both group and individual levels) was investigated in a subgroup of athletes with a stable outcome on psychological readiness within a two-week interval (n ​= ​27).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">The short ACL-RSI-NL demonstrated good construct validity (83% of hypotheses confirmed). Internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha 0.84), and there were no floor and ceiling effects (≤13.9% lowest or highest score). Test-retest reliability was good (ICC 0.89 with 95% CI 0.77-0.95, SEM 6.93, SDC individual level 19.2, SDC group level 3.7). Exploratory factor analysis confirmed the presence of a single underlying factor (accounting for 56.4% of the total variance of the score).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">The short ACL-RSI-NL exhibited good to excellent construct validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. An averaged score ranging from 0 to 100 can be used to measure psychological readiness to return to sport. The short ACL-RSI-NL has potential for use in day-to-day practice to assess the psychological readiness of recreational athletes to return to sport after ACL injury or ACLR during their rehabilitation process.</AbstractText>

TI  - Safety and Early Return to Sports for Early ACL Reconstruction in Young Athletes: A Retrospective Study.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <i>Background and Objectives</i>: Although previous reports have shown that early anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is associated with an increased risk of stiffness, recommendations for delayed surgery are based on outdated literature. The advent of arthroscopic surgery and accelerated rehabilitation protocols warrants a reexamination of the optimal surgical timing. The purpose of this study was to investigate complications during early ACL reconstruction after injury in young athletes. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: A total of 87 patients (27 males and 60 females) were included in this study. Patients who underwent anatomic ACL reconstruction using hamstring autografts were evaluated. Patients under 25 years of age with a Tegner activity score greater than 6 were included and classified into three groups according to the time from injury to surgical treatment: one week from injury to surgery (early group), three to six weeks from injury to surgery (normal group), and three to six months from injury to surgery (delayed group). We evaluated the rates of various complications such as graft rupture, contralateral injury, the need for manipulation for loss of ROM, infection, and fracture around the knee up to 2 years postoperatively. In addition, we investigated postoperative muscle strength, Lysholm score, Tegner activity score, and period of the return to sport from injury. <i>Results:</i> Patients in the delayed group were younger than those in the other groups (<i>p</i> = 0.009). Patients in the early group had a lower range of motion than those in the other groups preoperationly. However, the 1-month postoperative range of motion was comparable between groups. Patients in the early group had greater postoperative Tegner activity scores than those in the other groups. The period of return to sport from injury in the delayed group was longer than in the other groups. There were no statistically significant differences in the postoperative complication rate, muscle strength, or Lysholm score. <i>Conclusions</i>: ACL reconstruction performed 1 week from injury to surgery in young athletic patients indicated the rate of complications were not significantly different among the groups. Early ACL reconstruction with no postoperative complications may be related to early return to sports and a high level of sports.

TI  - Sex differences in corticospinal excitability and quadriceps performance after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures result in lasting quadriceps dysfunction that contributes to secondary injury risk and development of osteoarthritis. There is evidence of persistent reduced nervous system drive (corticospinal excitability [CSE]) to the quadriceps and sex differences in both quadriceps performance and CSE post-ACL reconstruction (ACLR). The purposes of this study were to investigate the differences in CSE and quadriceps dysfunction after ACLR between sexes and relative to controls. Twenty subjects 4-9 months post-ACLR and 20 age, sex, and activity matched controls participated in this study. Quadriceps performance (peak torque, PT; rate of torque development from onset to 100 ms, RTD100; and RTD from 100 to 200ms, RTD200) and CSE (active motor threshold; slope of the stimulus response (SR) curve, SR curve slope) were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (HUMAC NORM) and transcranial magnetic stimulation respectively. Significant group differences were found for SR curve slope, PT, RTD100, and RTD200 on the surgical limb. Males after ACLR had higher slopes (higher CSE) than females. Females after ACLR had worse surgical limb quadriceps PT than control males and slower RTD100 and RTD200 than control males and control females. Higher CSE in males after ACLR may point to a potentially adaptive neurological change in males post-ACLR and indicate greater need for novel interventions to address cortical drive in females after ACLR.

PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To evaluate the clinical outcomes in patients undergoing revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (r-ACLR) using hamstring tendon (HT) autografts with those using either quadriceps tendon (QT) or bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autografts or allografts.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Three databases were searched on 8 August 2023.

PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">To systematically review the literature to compare the efficacy and safety of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC), and hyaluronic acid (HA) injections for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase to identify Level I studies that compared the clinical efficacy of at least 2 of the following 3 injection therapies: PRP, BMAC, and HA for knee OA. The search phrase used was knee AND osteoarthritis AND randomized AND ("platelet rich plasma" OR "bone marrow aspirate" OR "hyaluronic acid"). Patients were primarily assessed based on patient-reported outcome scores (PROs) including the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score.</AbstractText>

TI  - Mid- to Long-Term Clinical Outcomes of Cartilage Restoration of Knee Joint with Allogenic Next-Generation Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (MACI).
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">Cartilage defect is a common pathology still lacking a unified treating option. The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and clinical and radiological outcome of cartilage restoration of knee joint with allogenic next-generation Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (MACI) for the first time, as well as the correlation between postoperative clinical and radiological outcomes and preoperative patient history and demographics.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">From July 2014 to August 2020, 15 patients who went through cartilage restoration with allogenic next-generation MACI were included in this study. Patient demographics and PROM including the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee score, Lysholm score, Tegner Activity Scale (TAS), and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were obtained preoperatively, at 3, 6, 12 months postoperatively and the last follow-up using an online questionnaire platform. MOCART 2.0 score was calculated at the last follow-up. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare PROM pre- and post-operation, with two-tailed p &lt; 0.05 defined as statistical significant. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlation between the PROM and MOCART 2.0 score at the last follow-up with patients demorgraphics.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">All patients were followed for an average of 66.47 ± 24.15 months (range, 21-93). All patients were satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and no complication was reported at the end of the study. No significant improvement was observed until 1 year after the implantation, except for IKDC score at 6 months. All PROM showed significant improvement 1 year post-op except for Lysholm score and TAS, which also increased significantly at the time of the last follow-up. Pearson correlation coefficient showed that the size of the defect, before or after debridement, was significantly negatively correlated with final KOOS-Pain (before debridement: r = -0.57, p &lt; 0.05; after debridement: r = -0.54, p &lt; 0.05) and KOOS-Symptoms score (before debridement: r = -0.66, p &lt; 0.05; after debridement: r = -0.67, p &lt; 0.05). The MOCART 2.0 score was found significantly and negatively correlated with BMI (r = -0.60, p &lt; 0.05), and significantly and positively correlated with Lysholm score (r = 0.70, p &lt; 0.05).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The next generation MACI with autologous chondrocyte and allogenic chondrocyte ECM scaffold could be used to treat focal articular cartilage defect in the knee joint safely and efficiently with lasting promising outcomes for more than 5 years. The size of the defects should be considered the most negatively correlated parameters influencing the postoperative clinical outcomes.</AbstractText>

TI  - Bioabsorbable interference screws for bone-patellar tendon-bone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: clinical and computerized tomography results of four different models. A prospective study
PY  - 2004
AB  - We investigated the effectiveness of four bioabsorbable interference screws for bone block fixation in ACL reconstruction, and assessed their complete absorption and graft integration. We performed a prospective clinical evaluation with the IKDC form and computed tomography (CT) scans 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with the bonepatellar tendon-bone (BPTB) technique. A total of 20 patients was divided into five groups according to the type of screw used for the femoral fixation (half-tunnel technique): group A, poly L-lactic acid; group B, polyglyconate copolymer; group C, lactic acid and glycolic acid copolymer; group D, polylactic acid; and group E (control), titanium. Proximal bone graft integration was always achieved within 6 and 12 months. Cystic bone absorption was observed in two group A patients. Ten screws were absorbed (9 completely; 1 partially): 1 completely and 1 partially in group A at 9 and 24 months; 4 in Group B between 12 and 18 months; 4 in Group C (2 each at 12 and 24 months); and none in Group D. The IKDC ratings were: group A, four patients with A; group B, 2 with A, 1 with B and 1 with C; group C, 2 with A, 2 with B; group D, 4 with A. Effusion that resolved within 6 months was noted in 2 group A and 2 group C patients. One patient in group B had a traumatic re-rupture of the graft; the screw was not found when he was re-operated at 18 months. The four bioabsorbable interference screws provided safe and effective bone block fixation during ACL reconstruction. Their 93.75% excellent and good overall IKDC results were in line with those achieved with metal interference screws. The fact that none of the group D screws (polylactic acid) were absorbed at 2 years indicates that absorption of polylactic acid is a slow biological process. This is also suggested by the absence of effusion in this group.

TI  - Effect of Fatigue on Hip and Knee Joint Biomechanics in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Deficient Patients
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The influence of fatigue on landing biomechanics in anterior cruciate ligament deficient (ACLD) patients is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of fatigue on hip and knee joint biomechanics in deficient patients. Twelve ACLD males and 12 healthy control subjects participated in the study. The ACLD patients landed with increased peak knee flexion angle (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic> = 15.71, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; .01) and decreased peak knee flexion moment (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic> = 9.13, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; .01) after fatigue. Furthermore, ACLD patients experienced lower vertical ground reaction forces compared with controls regardless of fatigue state (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic> = 9.75, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; .01). It seems that ACLD patients use protective strategy in response to fatigue in order to prevent further injury in knee point.</jats:p>

TI  - Day Case Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Surgery - A Study of Early Treatment Outcomes in a Regional Orthopaedic Centre.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Day-case anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has the potential benefit of reduced hospital stay and reduced cost of care. The goal of this preliminary report was to compare the outcome of day-case arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with those of in-patient care in terms of pain control and short-term functional outcome.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Materials and Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This was a prospective comparative study involving patients who had anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction performed in our unit between January 2019 to July 2021 for isolated anterior cruciate ligament rupture. The patients were offered the option of in-patient and day-case anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. All cases were isolated anterior cruciate ligament ruptures with no other ligament injury.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of twenty-one-day case and twenty-five in-patient anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were managed during the period of the study. The median numeric pain scores at day 2 and 7 in the day case group was 8.0 (IQR=2.0) and 5.0 (IQR= 3.0) respectively and in-patient group was 7.0 (IQR =1.5) and 4.0 (IQR= 2.0) respectively. The international knee documentation score (IKDC) at 6 months in the day case and in-patient groups were 68.6 (IQR= 9.3) and 67.2 (IQR= 25.0) respectively. The Mann-Whitney U test indicated that patients who had ACL reconstruction on in-patient care basis had statistically significant lower visual analogue scale pain scores on the second (z=-2.58, <i>P</i> = 0.01) and seventh (z=-3.41 <i>P</i> = 0.001) post-operative days compared to patients who had ACL reconstruction on day case basis. There was no statistically significant difference in the median IKDC scores of both groups at 6 months. The cost of care in the day case group was 40% lower than those of the in-patient group.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Although the cost of care in the day case group appeared lower as compared to the in-patient group, the day case group had higher post-operative pain scores compared to the in-patient group. Although the post-operative functional scores were similar in both groups, this was not statistically significant.</AbstractText>

AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">Some patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury initially treated with rehabilitation need ACL reconstruction (ACLR); yet, it is unclear what characterizes these patients. This review aimed to describe predictors for ACLR in patients initially treated with rehabilitation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A systematic literature search was performed in the Cochrane, Embase, Medline, SportsDiscus and Web of Science databases from inception to 21 February 2023. Articles describing characteristics in adult patients with ACL injury undergoing ACLR after a minimum of 5 weeks rehabilitation were included. It was a priori chosen that characteristics described in at least three articles were considered more certain and could be defined as a predictor for ACLR, and those described in less than three articles were considered less certain and therefore defined as possible predictors. Articles were screened by two independent reviewers. The study was originally intended as a systematic review with meta-analysis, but in case of limited data, we would convert it to a scoping review, as was the case for this review.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">There were 22,836 studies identified, and 181 full texts were screened, of which 10 papers were finally included. Only lower age and higher preinjury activity level were identified as predictors for ACLR. Another 12 possible predictors were identified in single studies. Through an iterative process, potential predictors were categorized into four groups: patient demographics, knee function, patient-reported outcome measures and anatomical structures.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Lower age and higher preinjury activity level were the only predictors for ACLR after initial treatment with rehabilitation. While younger and highly active patients show a higher need for ACLR, more studies focussing on predictors and reasons for delayed ACLR are warranted.</AbstractText>

TI  - Morphological Improvement of the Epiphyseal Plate and Trochlea After Surgical Correction in Skeletally Immature Patients With Patellar Dislocation and Trochlear Dysplasia.
PY  - 2025
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Studies have revealed abnormalities of the epiphyseal plate of the distal femur in patients with trochlear dysplasia, but it is unclear whether the epiphyseal plate could be remodeled after surgical correction of patellar dislocation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To investigate whether the morphology of the epiphyseal plate and trochlea could be improved after medial patellar retinaculum plasty in skeletally immature patients and to investigate the correlations between the morphology of the epiphyseal plate and trochlear dysplasia as well as clinical outcomes.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Eligible skeletally immature patients were retrospectively enrolled: 48 with patellar dislocation who received medial patellar retinaculum plasty in the surgical group, 41 with patellar dislocation who received nonoperative treatment in the nonsurgical group, and 96 without patellofemoral joint disorders in the control group. Three-dimensional modeling techniques using computed tomography scans of the distal femur were utilized to display the epiphyseal plate and trochlea. The epiphyseal plate was evaluated using surface area, volume, and trochlea-epiphysis distance. The trochlea was evaluated using surface area, volume, Dejour classification, trochlear groove depth, lateral condylar height, medial condylar height, sulcus angle, and lateral trochlear inclination. Radiological and clinical evaluations were performed.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">When compared with the control group at baseline, the surgical group had a smaller surface area and volume of the medial epiphyseal plate (<i>P</i> &lt; .001; <i>P</i> &lt; .001, respectively), a shorter medial and lateral trochlea-epiphysis distance (<i>P</i> &lt; .001; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), and a larger surface area and volume of the lateral epiphyseal plate (<i>P</i> = .001; <i>P</i> = .007). At final follow-up, the surgical group demonstrated numerous significant increases-in surface area and volume of the medial epiphyseal plate (<i>P</i> &lt; .001; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), medial and lateral trochlea-epiphysis distance (<i>P</i> &lt; .001; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), surface area and volume of the proximal trochlear groove (<i>P</i> &lt; .001; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), trochlear groove depth (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), lateral condylar height (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), medial condylar height (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), lateral trochlear inclination (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and proportion of normal + type A trochlea-whereas its sulcus angle (<i>P</i> &lt; .001) was significantly decreased. The morphological parameters of the epiphyseal plate and trochlea in the nonsurgical group were not significantly improved, except for lateral condylar height (<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and medial condylar height (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). The surgical group had better radiological outcomes than the nonsurgical group, including tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove distance, patellar tilt angle, patellar congruence angle, lateral patellar angle, and lateral patellar translation, as well as better clinical outcomes. The surface area and volume of the medial epiphyseal plate and medial and the lateral trochlea-epiphysis distance were risk factors for trochlear dysplasia and were positively correlated with patient-reported outcome measures.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The morphology of the dysplastic epiphyseal plate and trochlea were significantly improved, as accompanied by better radiological and clinical outcomes after surgical correction before epiphyseal closure in skeletally immature patients with patellar dislocation. Furthermore, the morphology of the medial epiphyseal plate and trochlea-epiphysis distance were risk factors for trochlear dysplasia and correlated with clinical outcomes.</AbstractText>

TI  - Single versus double hamstring tendon graft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in the paediatric patient: a single-blind randomised controlled trial study protocol.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION">There is currently no clear indication in the literature regarding a single or double hamstring tendon (single bundle) autograft for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in the paediatric patient. The primary aim of this single blind randomised controlled trial is to determine whether a single or double hamstring tendon graft ACLR leads to superior clinical outcomes postsurgery in paediatric patients with ACL injury.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS AND ANALYSIS">Single site, prospective, single blind, randomised controlled trial with two parallel treatment arms. 100 patients aged 10-18 years who present with an isolated ACL tear±meniscal injury, verified on MRI, will be randomly allocated to one of the two surgical groups. The primary outcomes will be side-to-side difference in anterior tibial translation and graft failure incidence 12 months postsurgery. Primary and secondary outcomes will also be assessed at 2-year and 5-year postsurgery.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION">Results will be presented in peer-reviewed journals and at international conferences and disseminated to participants and healthcare professionals via newsletters and hospital presentations. This study is approved by the Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service Human Research Ethics committee.</AbstractText>

TI  - Combined reconstruction of medial collateral ligament and posterior cruciate ligament using one femoral tunnel: a technical note and case report applicable to limited-resource settings.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Knee dislocations are severe injuries difficult to treat. Specially in low-resources scenarios, reconstruction of multiple ligaments can be challenging. We describe a technical note that can be reconstruct multi ligaments using ipsilateral hamstrings autograft. A posteromedial knee incision is made to visualise the medial corner of the knee and to reconstruct medial collateral ligament (MCL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) with semitendinosus and gracilis tendon graft, using one femoral tunnel from the anatomic femoral insertion of the MCL to the anatomic femoral insertion of the PCL. After 1-year follow-up, the patient returned to his previous function with a Lysholm score of 86. This technique can reconstruct more than one ligament anatomically with limited graft resource.

TI  - Association Between MRI Signal Intensity of the Repaired Lateral Meniscus and Residual Anterolateral Knee Laxity After ACL Reconstruction.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Anterolateral knee laxity (ALLx) has been linked to tears of the lateral meniscus (LM) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Purpose" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To investigate the longitudinal relationship between the signal intensity (SI) of the repaired LM on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and residual ALLx after ACL reconstruction (ACLR).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Study Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Included were 87 patients who underwent double-bundle ACLR and lateral meniscal repair (mean age, 23.5 years; body mass index, 23.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 56 women) at a single institution between 2010 and 2019. Proton density-weighted (PDW) and T2-weighted (T2W) MRI was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and the SI ratio (SIR) was calculated as (<i>SI of the repaired LM</i>)/(<i>SI of the posterior cruciate ligament</i>). At the 12-month follow-up, ALLx was evaluated using the pivot-shift test; an International Knee Documentation Committee grade ≥1 indicated residual ALLx.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Overall, 12 patients (13.8%) exhibited ALLx at 12 months postoperatively. At 3 months postoperatively, the SIR on PDW images (SIR-PDW) was significantly higher in patients with ALLx versus those without ALLx (1.98 ± 0.77 vs 1.49 ± 0.52, respectively; <i>P</i> = .007); there was no difference in the SIR on T2W images between the groups. SIR-PDW at 3 months postoperatively was correlated negatively with patient age (<i>r</i> = -0.308, <i>P</i> = .004). When patients were stratified into a younger (≤22 years; n = 53; ALLx = 7 [13.2%]) and an older (&gt;22 years; n = 34; ALLx = 5 [14.7%]) group, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for SIR-PDW in the younger group were statistically significant for predicting the prevalence of ALLx at all follow-up times (AUCs, 0.733-0.788) with optimal cutoff values of 2.00 at 3 months, 1.50 at 6 months, and 1.50 at 12 months. Logistic regression analysis revealed that if younger patients consistently had higher SIR-PDW values than the cutoff values, they were more likely to have residual ALLx (odds ratios, 10.24-23.57).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">For younger patients who underwent both ACLR and lateral meniscal repair, higher MRI SI of the repaired LM was associated with a higher prevalence of residual ALLx.</AbstractText>

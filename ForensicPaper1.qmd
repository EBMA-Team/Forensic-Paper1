# Analysis Preamble

I will extend this approach, by encapsulating a review within the contemporary reporting guidelines for the trial reported in the paper in question.

# Bibliometric Analysis

## The paper

Check if it appears in the RW database

```{r}

# Reporting Framework

To provide some structure to the following scrutiny of this article - the following guidelines were utilised.

CONSORT 2010 - [@moher2010]

CONSORT Parallel group trials - [@moher2010; @consort2010]

CONSORT Nonpharmacologic treatments - [@boutron2017]

CONSORT PRO - [@calvert2013]

CONSORT Harms - [@junqueira2023]

# Title and Abstract

# Methods - External assessment

This paper has been put through the wringer by SR-MA of graft type in ACL reconstruction. Let's do a quick summary of what others have said about the methods through RoB or methodology assessments in previous reviews.

I retrieved the citation list for this paper from *citationchaser* (the shiny app, I couldnt load the package because it kept tripping my antivirus) [@Haddaway2022]. It conducts a search through lens.org.

```{r}

Citations <- synthesisr::read_refs(
  filename = "C:/Users/cscho//Documents/GitHub/Forensic-Paper1/Paper1Citations",
  tag_naming = "wos",
  return_df = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)

```

Filter down for recent systematic reviews

```{r}

CitationsSR <- Citations |> dplyr::filter(
  stringr::str_detect(title,"(systematic.*review)|(meta.*analysis)")
) |> dplyr::arrange(
  year
)

```

## Risk of Bias

One systematic review [@janssen2017] used the Cochrane library checklist for RCTs, with two reviewers conducting independent ratings. The authors classified this trial as a *clinical controlled trial* (no formal randomisation) rather than a *randomised controlled trial*. The overall rating from the combined checklist score was *Questionable (*score was between 30% and 50%).

A more recent review [@sollberger2022] attempted to assess long term results after ACLR with PT vs HS autograft with a min follow up of 10 years, but did not include this paper in their analysis.

Another review [@migliorini2020] included it in their quality assessment, but did not break down their RoB ratings by individual paper.
